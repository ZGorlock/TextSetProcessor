            "joke": "So there's this Norwegian monk who grows carrots. He is world renowned for his carrots. They are known to be the juiciest, most delicious carrots on the face of the earth. He spends a large amount of his time in his garden, caring for his carrots. Well one day, while he is in said garden caring for his carrots, a thief jumps over the fence and steals 2 carrots. He looks up and makes eye contact with the monk, almost as if to say, \"hey... I've got your carrots.\" He then quickly turns and starts to break for the fence, which is now a considerable distance away as the garden doesn't start until a few hundred feet into the fence line. While the monk is a man of peace, he is not going to let some thief just waltz in and start stealing his carrots. These are, after all, the best carrots in the world. So the monk starts to give chase, but only 200 feet into the chase the monk is out of breath. The monk cannot run. So the monk starts getting in shape, practicing his 400 meter dash. Hour after hour, day after day, week after week. And he becomes so good, that he becomes the MONK CHAMPION that year in sprinting. The next day, he is in his garden, caring for his carrots, and a thief jumps over the same spot in the fence, runs to the same patch of carrots, and again takes 2 carrots. Only 2. \"This must be the same thief,\" thinks the monk (As all the mannerisms are exact matches). \"He's not getting my carrots this time-\" the monk well knowing he is the monk champion in sprinting. So the thief turns to make a break for the fence, but the monk gives steady chase. He is not far behind when the thief gets to the fence, and he simply leaps over. The monk is stuck. He can't jump. So the monk starts practicing hurdles.. Hour after hour, day after day, weak after week. He becomes so good at hurdling that he becomes the monk champion that year in hurdles. The next day he is in his garden, caring for his carrots, when of course, the same thief jumps over the fence, and takes TWO CARROTS. He again looks the monk in the eyes, almost as to say, \"I will steal your carrots forever monk.\" So the monk gives chase. He is gaining pretty well on the thief.. I mean.. He was monk champion earlier that year in sprinting. As they get to the fence the thief jumps over, and looks behind him with a smirk. But to his surprise, the monk hurdles over the fence with the greatest of ease. The monk is really gaining on the thief now. They run through the forest, the monk so ready to finally catch his thief, and put his questions to bed. Now just 20 or 30 feet behind the monk, they come to the lake behind the monks house. Monk can't swim. So the monk starts taking swimming lessons, hour after hour, day after day, week after week, and he actually becomes the MONK CHAMPION that year in Monk swimming. So the next day he is in his garden, caring for his carrots, when the SAME THIEF jumps over the fence and takes TWO CARROTS. They exchange eye contact and the chase begins. They run, they jump, they run, and then come to the lake. The thief jumps in and starts swimming away, but this time... Well THIS TIME the monk is RIGHT BEHIND the thief. The thief is practicing breast stroke, while the monk utilizes dolphin swim. They make their way out of the lake, the monk now just steps behind the thief as they come to the mountain. MONK CAN'T MOUNTAIN CLIMB. So the monk starts practicing mountain climbing. Hour after hour, day after day, week after week, and you know what. He becomes MONK CHAMPION that year in mountain climbing! So the next day the monk is in his garden, caring for his carrots, when as expected, the same thief jumps over the fence, steals two carrots. Always two. It is clear now to the monk that, the thief could hold more carrots, and he's obviously physically fit.. Why not take more? Two carrots alone cannot feed a family, or generate significant profit. It is this question most which bothers the monk. Why always two? Eager to have his question answer the chase ensues, and they run, and they jump, and they swim, and they run some more to the base of the mountain, the monk now just steps behind the thief. As the thief makes his way up the mountain, he pretentiously looks behind him with a smirk, only to realize the monk is now an arms reach behind him! As they reach the summit, the monk FINALLY GRABS THE THIEF. Ready for some answers he flips the thief around. And as he does the thief judo chops the monk. MONK DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO FIGHT!? So the monk starts practicing karate, hour after hour, day after day, week after week. And guess what. He becomes MONK CHAMPION that year in karate?!?! Simply amazing, all that this monk has accomplished. So the next day, the monk is in his garden, caring for his carrots, and the same thief jumps over the fence, as always, takes two carrots, as always, and begins to break for the fence. The chase is on, and the monk is ready for answers. They run, they jump, they swim, they run some more, they mountain climb, and at the summit, the monk again GRABS the thief and flips him around! The thief, in a display of desperation, DOUBLE JUDO CHOPS the monk, but the monk, crafty now in karate, blocks both chops and swiftly leg sweeps the thief to the ground. It is done. The thief is on the ground, the monk standing over him breathing heavy, comes down to one knee, and grabs the thief by the shirt, and pulls his back off the mountain so that their eyebrow lines meet, in a stare which can be compared to that of Arnold himself. The monk says to the thief, \"I don't care who you are... I don't care where you are from... Just tell me why. Why always two carrots!? What are you doing, that you always need... TWO... CARROTS?!?\" The thief now realizing his days of carrot thievery are over, complies with the monks wishes. He says to the monk, \"ok. I will tell you. But. This is so embarrassing. My actions with these carrots so unthinkable. The deeds so unimaginable... You have to promise never to tell anyone!\" And the monk never did.",

D. 79, no technology in this category existed. People were overpowered by the rage of a mountain that they believed was a sign of the wrath of the heavens. People had to flee the city and a majority of them we killed by either inhaling to much smoke or other causes. This continued for over 18 hours. Therefore, the destruction of Pompeii is far worse than tripping over a tree root.",

Earlier that morning the farmers daughter had inadvertently left the gate to the yard open as she was preoccupied by her worry over a maths test set for that day. She hadn't studied for the test as she was still deeply distressed over her fathers recent heart attack. This, coupled with the added burden of household chores now delegated to her because her mother was out trying to get the west field prepared for sowing, had made her quite forgetful and distracted of late. Whilst several chickens escaped, only one strayed so far that it actually encountered the road facing the farm. After crossing the road and gorging itself in a soybean crop, the chicken was struck by a furniture removers van as it attempted to make its way home. Several hours later the dead chicken was spotted by a Community Mental Health Worker who was doing his bi-weekly rural clinic run. The chicken, being a bantam caught the eye of the Mental Health worker, who was a keen trout fisherman. \"Cool,\" thought the mental health worker, - \"those feathers will make for excellent trout flies.\" He stopped and plucked a handful of the most iridescent blue, green and orange feathers and placed them in an envelope. He rolled himself a cigarette, sat on the trunk of his car and admired the clouds. \"God, I love this job,\" he muttered to no one in particular.",

I picked it up and dusted it off a little - when all of a sudden this enormous genie pops out! The genie thundered, 'You have released me from my ten-thousand year imprisonment, and I am in your debt. I will grant you three wishes as a token of my gratitude.'\" The man at the bar is agape. The guy with the big orange head continues: \"So I said, 'Wow, okay. Well, my first wish is to be fantastically wealthy.' The genie says, 'Your wish is granted.' And all of a sudden I have rings on my fingers and a crown on my head, and my wallet is full of money and a dozen ATM cards and the deed to a mansion in the hills - I mean, I was loaded! So I said, 'Amazing! Okay, for my next wish, I want to be married to the most beautiful woman in the world.' The genie says, 'Your wish is granted.' And the ocean parts, and out walks this gorgeous woman in this beautiful dress, and she takes my hand and we fall in love and the genie marries us right there. It was incredible. The genie booms, 'You have one wish remaining.'\" The man with the big orange head pauses and sips his beer. He says, \"Now, you know, this may be where I went wrong. I wished for a big orange head.\"",

As the three men talked, each was surprised to realize that all three of them had grown tired of playing the action hero - shooting the bad guys, pulling off life-threatening stunts, and getting the girl in the end. The whole scene was just all played out for them. By chance, Stallone had with him a script that his agent had given to him kind of as a joke. The script would allow three actors to act out the role of their favorite musical composer. The three men were delighted, and the agreement was made. Soon, a big budget studio was attached to the project, and Stephen Spielberg signed on to direct, everything was falling into place. On the day of the first pre-production meeting, the actors realized they needed to pick parts. Since Stallone had proposed the idea, he got to choose first. After thinking for a minute, he declared, \"I want to be Beethoven.\" The others agreed to let Stallone have Beethoven. Next, it was Van Dam's turn. He thought for a moment, then declared, \"I want to play Mozart.\" And the others agreed to that as well. Finally, it was Arnold Schwarzenegger's turn. After thinking about it for several moments, Schwarzenegger finally declared, *cue Terminator voice*: \"I'll be Bach.\"",

            "joke": "One year, I decided to buy my mother in Law a cemetery plot as a Christmas gift. The next year, I didn't buy her a gift. When she asked me why, I replied, \"Well, you still haven't used the gift I bought you last year!\" And that's how the fight started. My wife and I were watching 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire' while we were in bed. I turned to her and said, \"Do you want to have sex?\" \"No,\" she answered. I then said, \"Is that your final answer?\" She didn't even look at me this time, simply saying, \"Yes.\" So I said, \"Then I'd like to phone a friend.\" And that's how the fight started. I took my wife to a restaurant. The waiter, for some reason, took my order first. \"I'll have the rump steak, rare, please.\" He said, \"Aren't you worried about the mad cow?\" \"Nah, she can order for herself.\" And that's how the fight started. My wife and I were sitting at a table at her high school reunion, and she kept staring at a drunken man swigging his drink as he sat alone at a nearby table. I asked her, \"Do you know him?\" \"Yes,\" she sighed, \"He's my old boyfriend. I understand he took to drinking right after we split up those many years ago, and I hear he hasn't been sober since.\" \"My God!\" I said, \"Who would think a person could go on celebrating that long?\" And that's how the fight started. When our lawn mower broke and wouldn't run, my wife kept hinting to me that I should get it fixed. But, somehow I always had something else to take care of first, the shed, the boat, making beer. Always something more important to me. Finally she thought of a clever way to make her point. When I arrived home one day, I found her seated in the tall grass, busily snipping away with a tiny pair of sewing scissors. I watched silently for a short time and then went into the house. I was gone only a minute, and when I came out again I handed her a toothbrush. I said, \"When you finish cutting the grass, you might as well sweep the driveway.\" The doctors say I will walk again, but I will always have a limp. My wife sat down next to me as I was flipping channels. She asked, \"What's on TV?\" I said, \"Dust.\" And that's how the fight started. Saturday morning I got up early, quietly dressed, made my lunch, and slipped quietly into the garage. I hooked up the boat up to the van and proceeded to back out into a torrential downpour. The wind was blowing 50 mph, so I pulled back into the garage, turned on the radio, and discovered that the weather would be bad all day. I went back into the house, quietly undressed, and slipped back into bed. I cuddled up to my wife's back; Now with a different anticipation, and whispered, \"The weather out there is terrible.\" My loving wife of 5 years replied, \"And can you believe my stupid husband is out fishing in that?\" And that's how the fight started. I rear-ended a car this morning... The start of a REALLY bad day! The driver got out of the other car, and he was a DWARF! He looked up at me and said, \"I am NOT Happy!\" So I said, \"Well, which one ARE you then?\" And that's how the fight started. My wife was hinting about what she wanted for our upcoming anniversary. She said, \"I want something shiny that goes from 0 to 160 in about 3 seconds.\" I bought her a bathroom scale. And that's how the fight started. After retiring, I went to the Social Security office to apply for Social Security. The woman behind the counter asked me for my driver's license to verify my age. I looked in my pockets and realized I had left my wallet at home. I told the woman that I was very sorry, but I would have to go home and come back later. The woman said, \"Unbutton your shirt.\" So I opened my shirt revealing my curly silver hair. She said, \"That silver hair on your chest is proof enough for me,\" and she processed my Social Security application. When I got home, I excitedly told my wife about my experience at the Social Security office. She said, \"You should have dropped your pants. You might have gotten disability too.\" And that's how the fight started. My wife was standing nude, looking in the bedroom mirror. She was not happy with what she saw and said to me, \"I feel horrible; I look old, fat and ugly. I really need you to pay me a compliment.\" I replied, \"Your eyesight's damn near perfect.\" And that's how the fight started.",

Dogs agree that you have to raise your voice to get your point across. You never have to wait for a dog; They're ready to go, instantly, 24 hours a day. Dogs find you amusing when you're pissed.

When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.\" The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. \"In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the Earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.\" The monks reply, \"Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.\" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \"The sound is beyond that door.\" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, \"This is the last key to the last door.\" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...

When applying it in the bathroom they would then press their lips to the mirror and leave lip prints. Before it got out of hand he thought of a way to stop it. He gathered all the girls together that wore lipstick and told them he wanted to meet with them in the ladies room at 2 PM. They gathered at 2 PM and found the principal and the school custodian waiting for them. The principal explained that it was becoming a problem for the custodian to clean the mirror every night. He said he felt the ladies did not fully understand just how much of a problem it was and he wanted them to witness just how hard it was to clean. The custodian then demonstrated. He took a long brush on a handle out of a box. He then dipped the brush in the nearest toilet, moved to the mirror and proceeded to remove the lipstick. That was the last day the girls pressed their lips on the mirror.",

After a fulfilling life with the now dead prince, she happily sits upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by from her front porch, with a cat named Bob for companionship. One sunny afternoon out of nowhere, appeared the fairy godmother. Cinderella asked, \"Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all these years?\" The fairy godmother replied, \"Cinderella, you have lived an exemplary life since I last saw you. Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?\" Cinderella was taken aback, overjoyed, and after some thoughtful consideration, she uttered her first wish: \"The prince was wonderful, but not much of an investor. I'm living hand to mouth on my disability checks and I wish I were wealthy beyond comprehension.\" Instantly her rocking chair turned into solid gold Cinderella said, \"Oh, thank you, Fairy Godmother.\" The fairy godmother replied, \"it is the least that I can do. What do you want for your second wish?\" Cinderella looked down at her frail body, and said, \"I wish I were young and full of the beauty and youth I once had.\" At once, her wish became reality, and her beautiful young visage returned. Cinderella felt stirrings inside of her that had been dormant for years. And then the fairy godmother spoke once more: \"You have one more wish; What shall it be?\" Cinderella looks over to the frightened cat in the corner and says, \"I wish for you to transform Bob, my old cat, into a kind and handsome young man.\" Magically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biological make-up that, when he stood before her, he was a man so beautiful the likes of him neither she nor the world had ever seen. The fairy godmother said, \"Congratulations, Cinderella, enjoy your new life.\" With a blazing shock of bright blue electricity, the fairy godmother was gone as suddenly as she appeared. For a few eerie moments, Bob and Cinderella looked into each other's eyes. Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most beautiful, stunningly perfect man she had ever seen. Then Bob walked over to Cinderella, who sat transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young muscular arms. He leaned in close, blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he whispered... \"Bet you're sorry you neutered me.\"",

First of all, - just for some background: My Mum died right when I was born, (She was actually really, really hot- but this isn't about her. I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up. Anyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie. I don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it). Sooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home. My friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... And it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly. After we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging. Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time. My friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips. Sadly (Although, I guess for the best) Nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... And I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her. But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (Not like a date or anything romantic like that), And she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh. A little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (The sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised. But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... My friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone. It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.",

The man spoke with the tribe and they allowed him to stay with them and sleep on their grounds. The first night, the man didn't sleep a wink due to the ongoing drumming so he spoke to the chief. \"Chief, I got no sleep last night. Could you maybe stop the drumming for a night so I could rest.\" The chief replied, \"The drums must not stop.\" The man figured it was their culture and focused on enjoying the day, studying and spending time with the tribe. That night, the drums again kept the man awake for the whole night and in the morning he spoke with the chief. \"Chief, please! I need some sleep; Couldn't the drums cease for just one night for my health?\" The chief replied, \"The drums must not stop.\" The man, frustrated, let the issue drop and tried to focus on the day at hand, but could not focus due to lack of sleep and the incessant pounding of the drums. That night, the beating of the drums left the man sleepless yet again in the morning he angrily approached the chief. \"Chief, I've just about had it. The drums must stop; It is impossible to get and rest with them.\" The chief replied, \"The drums must not stop.\" \"Why! Why can the drums not stop? What happens when the drums stop?!\" The chief replied, \"Bass solo.\"",

They immediately began to argue with one another as to who was at fault for the mishap. When the snake remarked that he had been blind since birth, and thus should be given additional leeway, the rabbit said that he, too, had been blind since birth. The two animals then forgot about the collision and began commiserating concerning the problems of being blind. The snake said that his greatest regret was the loss of his identity. He had never been able to see his reflection in the water, and for that reason did not know exactly what he looked like, or even what he was. The rabbit declared that he had the same problem. Seeing a way that they could help each other, the rabbit proposed that one feel the other from head to toe, and then try to describe what the other animal was. The snake agreed, and started by winding himself around the rabbit. After a few moments, he announced, \"You've got very soft, fuzzy fur, long ears, big rear feet, and a little fuzzy ball for a tail. I think that you must be a bunny rabbit!\" The rabbit was much relieved to find his identity, and proceeded to return the favor to the snake. After feeling about the snake's body for a few minutes, he asserted, \"Well, you're scaly, you're slimy, you've got beady little eyes, you squirm and slither all the time, and you've got a forked tongue. I think you're a lawyer!\"",

Then, she would proceed to yell and scream at him for his constant nights out and coming home in a drunken state. But, Harry still continued his nightly routine. One day, the distraught wife was talking to a friend about her husband's behavior. The friend listened and suggested, \"Why don't you treat him a little differently when he comes home? Instead of berating him, why don't you give him some loving words and welcome him home with a kiss? Then, he might change his ways.\" The wife thought this might be a good idea. That night, Harry took off again after dinner. And, at about midnight, he arrived home in his usual condition. His wife heard him at the door. She quickly opened it and let Harry in. Instead of beating him as she had always done, this time she took his arm and led him into the living room. She sat Harry down in an easy chair, put his feet up on the foot stool, and took his shoes off. Then, she went behind him and started to cuddle him a little. After a short while, she whispered to Harry, \"It's pretty late, dear. I think we should go upstairs to bed now, don't you think?\" Harry replied in his inebriated state, \"Heck, I guess we might as well. I'll get in trouble when I get home anyway!\"",

John Bradford, a Dublin University student, was on the side of the road hitchhiking on a very dark night and in the midst of a storm. The night was rolling on and no car went by. The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him. Suddenly, he saw a car slowly coming towards him and stopped. John, desperate for shelter and without thinking about it, got into the car and closed the door only to realize there was nobody behind the wheel and the engine wasn't on! The car started moving slowly. John looked at the road ahead and saw a curve approaching. Scared, he started to pray, begging for his life. Then, just before the car hit the curve, a hand appeared through the window and turned the wheel. John, paralyzed with terror, watched as the hand repeatedly came through the window, but never touched or harmed him. Shortly thereafter, John saw the lights of a pub appear down the road, so, gathering strength, he jumped out of the car and ran to it. Wet and out of breath, he rushed inside and started telling everybody about the scarey horrible experience he had just had. A silence enveloped the pub when everybody realized he was crying and... Wasn't drunk. Suddenly, the door opened, and two other people walked in from the stormy night. They, like John, were also soaked and out of breath. Looking around, and seeing John Bradford sobbing at the bar, one said to the other... \"Look Paddy... There's that f... Idiot who got in the car while we were pushing it.\"",

Why did they applaud for me just because I went to the restroom?\" \"Well, now they know you're one of us,\" said the bartender, \"Would you like a drink?\" \"But, I still don't understand,\" said the puzzled nun. \"You see,\" laughed the bartender, \"every time the fig leaf on the statue is lifted up, the lights go out in the whole place.

In his hand he carried a worn out old hat and an equally worn out Bible. The church he entered was in a very upscale and exclusive part of the city. It was the largest and most beautiful church the old cowboy had ever seen. The people of the congregation were all dressed with expensive clothes and accessories. As the cowboy took a seat, the others moved away from him. No one greeted, spoke to, or welcomed him. They were all appalled at his appearance and did not attempt to hide it. As the old cowboy was leaving the church, the preacher approached him and asked the cowboy to do him a favor. \"Before you come back in here again, have a talk with God, and ask him what he thinks would be appropriate attire for worship.\" The old cowboy assured the preacher he would. The next Sunday, he showed back up for the services wearing the same ragged jeans, shirt, boots, and hat. Once again he was completely shunned and ignored. The preacher again approached the man and said, \"I thought I asked you to speak to God before you came back to our church.\" \"I did,\" replied the old cowboy. \"If you spoke to God, what did he tell you the proper attire should be for worshiping in here?\" Asked the preacher. \"Well, sir, God told me that He didn't have a clue what I should wear. He said He'd never been in this church.\"",

Captain Bravado bellowed, \"Bring me my red shirt!\" The first mate quickly retrieved the captain's red shirt, and while wearing the brightly colored frock, the Captain led his crew into battle and defeated the mighty pirates. That evening, all the men sat around on deck recounting the triumph of earlier. One of them asked the Captain, \"Sir, why did you call for your red shirt before battle?\" The Captain replied, \"If I were to be wounded in the attack, the shirt would not show my blood. Thus, you men would continue to fight, unafraid.\" All of the men sat and marveled at the courage of such a manly man's man. As dawn came the next morning, the lookout spotted not one, not two, but TEN pirate ships approaching. The crew stared in worshipful silence at the Captain and waited for his usual orders. Captain Bravado gazed with steely eyes upon the vast armada arrayed against his ship, and without fear, turned and calmly shouted, \"Get me my brown pants.\"",

She's also managed to wash up on shore from the sinking ship. He makes his way to her, and with some mouth-to-mouth assistance he manages to get her breathing again. She looks up at him, wide-eyed and grateful and says, \"My God, you saved my life!\" He suddenly realizes the woman is Cindy Crawford! Days and weeks go by. Cindy and our guy are living on the island together. They've set up a hut, there's fruit on the trees, and they're in heaven. Cindy's fallen madly in love with our man, and they're making passionate love morning, noon and night. Alas, one day she notices he's looking kind of glum. \"What's the matter, sweetheart?\" She asks, \"We have a wonderful life together, I'm in love with you. Is there something wrong? Is there anything I can do?\" He says, \"Actually, Cindy, there is. Would you mind, putting on my shirt?\" \"Sure,\" she says, \"if it will help.\" He takes off his shirt and she puts it on. \"Now would you put on my pants?\" He asks. \"Sure, honey, if it's really going to make you feel better,\" she says. \"Okay, would you put on my hat now, and draw a little mustache on your face?\" He asks. \"Whatever you want, sweetie,\" she says, and does. Then he says, \"Now, would you start walking around the edge of the island?\" She starts walking around the perimeter of the island. He sets off in the other direction. They meet up half way around the island a few minutes later. He rushes up to her, grabs her by the shoulders, and says, \"Dude! You'll never believe who I'm sleeping with!\"",

The zookeeper offered the mime a job to dress up as Sparky until they could get a new gorilla. The mime accepted. The next morning, the mime put on a gorilla suit and entered the cage before the crowd arrived. He discovered that it was a great job! He could sleep all he wanted, play and make fun of people and he was drawing bigger crowds than he ever did as a mime. However, eventually the crowds tired of him, and he was getting bored just swinging on tires. He began to notice that the people were paying more attention to the lion in the cage next to his. Not wanting to lose the attention of his audience, he climbed to the top of his cage, crawled across a partition, and dangled from the top over the lion's cage. Of course, this made the lion furious, but the crowd loved it. At the end of the day the zoo keeper was thrilled, and even gave the mime a raise for being such a good attraction. This went on for some time, the mime kept taunting the lion, the crowds grew larger, and his salary kept going up. Then one terrible day when he was dangling over the furious lion, he lost his grip and fell. The mime was terrified. The lion gathered itself and prepared to pounce. The mime was so scared that he began to run round and round the cage with the lion close behind. When no help came, and the crowd looked on in shock, the mime started screaming and yelling. Help, Help me! \"He screamed, but the lion was too quick and pounced. The mime found himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion, who was just inches away from his face when he whispered,\" Shut up you idiot! Do you want to get us both fired?",

Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the car's performance to diminish by 50% or more. Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation by the Justice Department. 12) Every time GM introduced a new model car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car. 13) You'd press the,\" start, \"button to shut off the engine.\"",

They would always comment that he was two bricks shy of a load, or two pickles short of a barrel. To prove it, sometimes they would offer Johnny his choice between a nickel (5 cents) And a dime (10 cents) And John would always take the nickel... They said, because it was bigger. One day after Little Johnny grabbed the nickel, the store owner took him aside and said, \"Johnny, those boys are making fun of you. They think you don't know the dime is worth more than the nickel. Are you grabbing the nickel because it's bigger, or what?\" Slowly, Little Johnny turned toward the store owner and a big grin appeared on his face and he said, \"Well, if I took the dime, they'd stop doing it, and so far I have saved $20!\"",

After checking the couple out, the doctor told them that they were physically okay but might want to start writing things down and make notes to help them remember things.

You had better write that down because I know you'll forget that.\" He said, \"I can remember that, you want a bowl of ice cream with strawberries.\" She replied, \"Well I also would like whipped cream on top.

After about 20 minutes he returned from the kitchen and handed her a plate of bacon and eggs. She stared at the plate for a moment and said angrily: \"I TOLD you to write it down!

After a few minutes though, the engines start revving, and the airplane begins moving down the runway. The passengers look at each other with some uneasiness. They start whispering among themselves and look desperately to the stewardesses for reassurance. Yet, the plane starts accelerating rapidly, and people begin panicking. Some passengers are praying, and as the plane gets closer and closer to the end of the runway, the voices are becoming more and more hysterical. When the plane has less than twenty feet of runway left, there is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone screams at once. At the very last moment, the plane lifts off and is airborne. Up in the cockpit, the copilot breathes a sigh of relief and tells the pilot: \"You know, one of these days the passengers aren't going to scream, and we aren't going to know when to take off!\"",

As a result, they only just arrived now! The professor thought it over and then agreed they could make up their final exam the following day. The guys were elated and relieved. They studied hard that night - all night - and went in the next day at the time the professor had told them. He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet, (Which was out of 100 points) And told them to begin. The first problem was worth five points. It was something simple about free radical formation. Cool, they all thought in their separate rooms, \"this is going to be easy.\" Each finished the problem and then turned the page.

So the man goes into the dining room to find the farmer's incredibly hot, overdeveloped 19-year old daughter sitting at the table. They all had a nice meal together, after which the farmer invited the traveler onto the back porch for an after-dinner whiskey. \"Well,\" said the farmer, \"We ain't got no phone, but you can stay the night here, and in the mornin', I'll drive you into town on my tractor. But lemme tell you one thing... My daughter in there is an unspoilt flower, and if you lay so much as one finger on her, I'll blow your head clean off. Do we understand each other?\" \"Yes sir, thank you very much for your kindness.\" Said the man, even as he pictured the farmers daughter dressing into her bedclothes. The next morning, the man woke to find the farmer standing over him with a shotgun.. He jumped up quick as a flash.. \"Wait!\" He shouted, \"I swear I didn't touch your daughter!\" \"Oh... Well I knew that..\" The farmer said. \"I was just gonna show you my new shotgun, it's really cool.\" Then he drove him into town to find a phone, where the man thanked him and gave him a few bucks for gas.",
