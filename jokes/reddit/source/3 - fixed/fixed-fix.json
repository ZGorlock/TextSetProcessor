Gimme $50 dollars, and I will tell you what you need to do, and if you can do it, you get everything inside it.\" The man thinks it over for a bit while drinking a few beers, and in his slightly intoxicated state decides that hes gonna try to win the money. He slurrs out, \"Ok Barkeep, here's $50 big ones. Whats I got to do?\" The barkeep smiles and says, \"There are four things you must do. First, you have to drink 10 beers and 10 shots in 10 minutes. Next, you see that group of mean old bikers in the back? They come in every night and make a big mess. I need you to take one of these beer bottles and smash it over one of their heads. After that, I have got an old pitbull in the back that has a mean toothache, I need you to go back there and pull it out. And finally, my 85 year old grandmother is up stairs. She was a whore in Romania for almost 35 years. I need you to go upstairs and have your way with her.\" So the man races down the beers and shots in under 8 minutes, to the amazement of the bar keep. He grabs one of the beer bottles and walks up to the biggest biker in the back and smashes it over his head, knocking him out cold. A few of the other bikers rough him up a bit but he keeps going. He stumbles out side and from inside the bar, all the barkeep hears is the most horrible screaming and yelping he has ever heard. After what seems like an hour, the man comes back in, clothes torn to bits and bloodied and rushes to the bar keep and slurrs out, \"Now wheresh that old whore with the bad tooth?\"",

As the doctor was screaming in pain and yelling obscenities, Joe, watching, decided to help. He ran and grabbed his pair of barbecue tongs from his car and began grabbing the crabs and tossing them in a nearby trash can. The doctor was greatly pleased by this, and offered Joe a discount if he would help with the next surgery.

The keeper discloses, however, that the bird was born with no legs, among another odd birth defect. Doubloon of course inquires, \"How he be a'holdin 'is ground?\" Smartly, the parrot replied, \"Awk! With me yardarm of course,\" to which the parrot opens his wings and reveals his other birth defect, his wraparound length tally-whacker. The captain is amazed at the impressive appendage, and of course considers the parrot perfect among his mangy and motley crew. Captain Loony Doubloon and the newly-monikered Tiltin Yardarm fast become talkative mates, and the captain wastes no time in warning his feathery friend of his cunning and lecherous first mate, Rusty Pegleg. \"A foul bosom's mate he is, he'll steal your wench from ye as soon as he'd steal the bung from its hole!\" They voyage on, and at the next port the crew finds a slew of horny wenches, of which the captain always gets the first pick. Doubloon immediately picks the sauciest wench of the bunch, taking well into account as Rusty Pegleg drools at the mere sight of her. The captain keeps his lady waiting in his quarters while he settles with the mistress of the brothel, betting his first mate wouldn't be brazen enough to plunder the Captain's choice pick with Tiltin Yardarm bearing witness. However, when the Captain returns, his wench is gone, and Yardarm begins to squawk a terrible account. Loony Doubloon is incensed, -\"What transpired 'ere, and where's me choice wench?!\" \"Awk!

She was clawing for him to take her, begging him, pleading him 'Oh captain, Oh captain!'\" To this, the maddened Captain Loony Doubloon thrusts the tip of his blade to the edge of the poor parrot's neck, -\"Every bloody detail or yer to walk the plank and find Davey Jones locker with 'im!\" Tiltin Yardarm swallows heavily and replies, -\"I can't bear witness to what happened next.

While the waiter was away in the kitchen, Sid said, 'I find it hard to believe that there are no Jews in India. Our people are scattered everywhere.' The waiter returned and said, 'Cooksaheb say there is no Indian Jews.' 'Are you certain?' Al asked once again, 'I just can't believe there are no Indian Jews!'! Listen, I asked EVERYONE,' replied the frustrated waiter. 'All we have is Mango Jews, Pineapple Jews, Orange Jews, Coconut Jews and Tomato Jews! - No Indian Jews!'",

It was a great game, but unfortunately ended in a draw. We took a taxi back to the hotel, but on the way I started to feel funny. I had some pains in my chest and felt short of breath. I chalked it up to the long day I had just had, but I continued to feel worse. As we got out of the taxi and walked into the hotel, I collapsed. It became apparent to my wife and I that I was having a heart attack! I thought for sure I would die because the nearest hospital was 1/2 hour away. Suddenly from the back room came a woman wielding defibrillators. She shouted to the other staff to help and they ripped off my shirt and restarted my heart right there in the hotel! The ambulance arrived 20 minutes later, but thanks to this amazing woman my life had been saved. I spent the night in the hospital but I got out around noon the next day. I went back to the hotel to thank this woman. I said, \"I'm amazed that a hotel this small has a full time doctor as skilled as yourself!\" She replied, \"no one expects the Spanish inn physician.\"",

Having boned up on ornithology and traditional Chinese medicine, he decided that the answer was a prescription of gum-tree leaf tea. He gathered bushels of the tea leaves, brewed gallons of the tea, and poured it into the chicken for the two months. Meanwhile, Ming traveled all around China, praying at the shrines of his ancestors. One night he had a dream. His ancestors appeared and told him to feed the chicken tea made from gum-tree leaves! Ming, aware of his brother's lack of success, decided that the problem was quantity. He gathered whole CARTLOADS of leaves, and brewed BARRELS of the tea, and poured them into the chicken for the two months. At the end of the time, the poor chicken was still as naked as a bowling ball. Moral: All of Hing's courses, and all of Ming's kin; Couldn't make gum tea refeather a hen!",

He opened the door to the confession booth and frantically spotted two altar boys. \"You two,\" he shouted. \"Watch the booth for me, until I get back.\" Once he left, the younger boy went in the booth and started listening to confession. First a man came in and admitted to having impure thoughts. The boy told him to say 5 Hail Mary's. The next man came in and admitted to stealing his neighbor's newspaper, the boy told him to say 10 Hail Mary's. Then a woman came in and admitted to cheating on her husband, by giving another man a blowjob. Sensing that this was a pretty serious offense, the altar boy wasn't quite sure how to handle it. So he opened the door and called out to the other altar boy, \"Hey Ricky, what does the preacher give for a blowjob?\" Ricky replied, \"A couple Snickers bars and a soda.\"",

That's strange.\" Just then he feels a tap on his shoulder. He lowers the rifle and looks behind him. He gasps in fear as he sees the bear standing over him. \"What do we have here?\" Says the bear. \"Looks like a free lunch.\" \"Oh please don't eat me says John. I will do anything.\" \"Well...\" The bear says, \"There is one thing. You have to let me fuck you in the ass. Then I will let you go.\" \"Um... Ok. Just don't eat me.\" Says John.

John is so angry that the next day he goes back to the gun shop and tells them he needs a bigger gun and that he is going to get that damn bear. \"Give me that 7mm rifle!\" John buys the rifle and the next day goes to the ridge. Scanning with the binos he sees the bear again! \"Got you now!\" He whispers to himself. He shoulders the rifle, looks the scope, and the bear is gone again. \"What the hell?\" He thinks. Just then a tap on his shoulder startled him. He turns around in shock to see the bear there standing over him again. \"Back again I see.\" Says the bear. \"What will it be this time? Do I eat you or fuck you?\" \"Fuck me,\" John grumbles under his breathe. So the bear fucks him again and lets him go. The next day he is so furious that he returns to the gun shop again. \"I want the biggest weapon you have here!\" John screams at the salesman. \"I'm gonna get that fucking bear!\" \"Ok, well, its not really legal but we have this RPG in the back. Be careful though because we only have one rocket,\" says the clerk. The next day, John returns to the ridge determined to kill the bear. He looks through the binos for the bear, locating him near some trees. \"This time you are mine!\" John whispers to himself. He grabs the RPG, aims into the valley, but no bear. Again he feels a tap on his shoulder. Hanging his head, John turns around to see the bear there again smiling at him. The bear says, \"You ain't here for the hunting are you boy...\"",

He boarded the bus and found a seat next to a group of boys, whom he heard talking fast and excitingly. Jimmy couldn't make out much of what they were saying, but he did hear the phrase, \"purple wombat,\" repeated multiple times. \"But what is the purple wombat?\" Jimmy asked. One of the boys turned to him, \"You don't know what the purple wombat is?\" Jimmy was about to answer, \"no,\" but it was time to leave the bus and go to his first class. In this class he again heard some kids talking about the purple wombat and again asked them what it meant. \"Jimmy, would you please come up here for a second.\" The teacher said. Jimmy went up. \"Don't you know not to talk in class?\" The teacher asked. \"Yes,\" said Jimmy, \"but I was just asking about the purple wombat.\" With that the teacher scolded him and sent him to the principal's office. In there the principal asked him what was the cause of him being sent there. \"I just asked about the purple wombat!\" Jimmy exclaimed. \"That's it young man, you're going home right now!\" Yelled the principal. At home his mother was furious and demanded to know the reasons for Jimmy being sent home. \"All I did was ask about the purple wombat.\" Jimmy sobbed. \"Go to your room right now!\" Ordered his mother. Jimmy went to his room and stayed there for the rest of the day. At around midnight he heard a strange sound coming from outside his window. It was a voice. Jimmy opened his window to hear it better. \"Jiiimmmmmmmyyyy, I am the purple wombat, come to the island on the lake tomorow night.\" Said the strange yet soothing voice. Jimmy was so excited, he would finally know what all the fuss was about. The next night, Jimmy got his canoe out of the shed and brought it down to the lake next to his house. He rowed out on the water and headed toward the small island. When he was close enough, he saw the purple wombat on the shore. Overcome with excitement, Jimmy stood up, but accidentally shook the canoe and fell overboard. Moral of the story: Don't stand up in canoes.",

He doesn't kiss his mother hello. Instead, he goes straight to his room and starts studying. Books and papers are spread out all over the room and little Tommy is hard at work. His mother is amazed. She calls him down to dinner and to her shock, the minute he is done he marches back to his room without a word and in no time he is back hitting the books as hard as before. This goes on for sometime, day after day while the mother tries to understand what made all the difference. Finally, little Tommy brings home his report card. He quietly lays it on the table and goes up to his room and hits the books. With great trepidation, his mom looks at it and to her surprise, little Tommy got an A in math. She can no longer hold her curiosity. She goes to his room and says: \"Son, what was it? Was it the nuns?\" Little Tommy looks at her and shakes his head. \"Well then,\" she replies, \"was it the books, the discipline, the structure, the uniforms, WHAT was it?\" Little Tommy looks at her and says, \"Well, on the first day of school, when I saw that guy nailed to the plus sign, I knew they weren't fooling around.\"",

As he is staring at the pig, the farmer emerges from the barn and extends a greeting. The young salesman introduces himself, but then curiosity gets a hold of him and he asks the farmer about the pig with the wooden leg. The farmer replies, \"Well young man, that is no ordinary pig. That's a special pig.\" \"I can see that,\" said the young salesman, \"but why does he have a wooden leg?\" \"Well let me tell you.\" Said the farmer. \"One day I was plowing right there on the other side of that pig's pen when I stopped the tractor to move a big rock out of the way. Don't you know that tractor slipped into gear and would have run me over 'cept that pig broke through the fence and pushed me out of the way just in time.\" \"So is that how the pig lost his leg?\" \"No, no, no,\" said the farmer, \"I'm trying to tell you that is one special pig. Why just a couple of months ago the wife and I were sound asleep about three in the morning when a fire broke out on the porch over there. That pig broke through the pen, rushed to the house and made such a ruckus we were woken up in time to put out the fire.

Why just four weeks ago I was home alone. I had a heart attack. That pig ran into the road and right in front of the first car that came by.

Twisting, shouting, and asking the German for help, he eventually ends up hanging upside down, his face bloody and, although he put in the effort, he just didn't get the desired results.

The Ruskis wait for the gunshot and are rewarded. But when they check behind the tree line to retrieve the body, they find none. They shrug, thinking that there's no way he could possibly have run off to some place warmer. But with one less skin and winter approaching, they move on to next prisoner. Last is the Japanese. Stoic to the end, he gets on his knees and draws his sword. Plunging it into his gut and twisting it every which way, he never even flinches.

Upon hearing that the priest has a few hours off the fisherman invites him out to sea to fish with him. Out at sea it doesn't take long for the fisherman to realize that the priest has no idea how to fish, so he gives him some quick instruction and shows him how to cast his bait out into the water. Within moments the priest manages to reel in the largest fish that the fisherman has ever seen. In the moment of excitement the fisherman exclaims, \"Look at the size of that Son-of-a-bitch!\" Immediately the priest becomes disturbed and says, \"My son, please don't use such language.\" The fisherman, embarrassed and hoping word of this gaffe will not reach the rest of his family, makes up an explanation in a moment of ingenuity, \"Oh no father, that's the name of that type of fish, a son-of-a-bitch.\" He lies, taking advantage of the priests fishing naivete. The priest is pacified, and begs forgiveness for jumping to conclusions. The fisherman, relieved, brings the priest back to the docks and drops him off. The priest lumbers back to the church, with the giant fish in his arms. Upon entering the church he sees the bishop and approaches him, \"Bishop, look at the size of this son-of-a-bitch I caught!\" The bishop stands wide-eyed a moment, \"Priest, how could a man as holy as you use such language in the house of God?\" The priest calmly explains that it is the name of the fish, and the bishop feeling embarrassed for jumping to conclusions offers to take and clean the fish for the priest. After cleaning the fish the bishop takes it to the maid in the kitchen and tells her, \"Maid, I want you to cook this son-of-a-bitch for me.\" The maid blushes and responds, \"Bishop, it may not be my place to say so, but is such language fitting for a man of your stature?\" The bishop laughs haughtily, explains that it's the name of the fish and that he too had made the same mistake only minutes earlier. The maid laughs too, apologizes and cooks the fish. It just so happens that the Pope decided to stop in for dinner at their church that evening. They are all sitting at the table when the pope says, \"Oh, my children, I know that gluttony is a sin but I simply can't stop myself from eating this fish. I must know, where did you get it?\" \"I caught the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the priest. \"I cleaned the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the bishop. \"And I cooked the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the maid.

After paying $500,000, he takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light. While waiting for the light to change, an frail looking old man on a yellow moped pulls up next to him. The old man looks over at the Ferrari and asks, \"What kind of car ya' got there, Sonny?\" The young man replies, \"A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!\" \"Wheeewee... That's a lot of money,\" says the old man as he tucks his thumbs up against his suspenders. \"Why does it cost so much?\" \"Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!\" States the banker proudly. The moped driver asks, \"Mind if I take a look inside?\" \"No problem,\" replies the proud new owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around at all the bells and whistles lining the dashboard. Sitting back on his moped, the old man whistles and says, \"That's a pretty nice car, all right... But I'll stick with my moped!\" Just then the light changes, so the banker decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph! Suddenly, he notices a yellow dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be, and suddenly... Whoooooosssshhhhh! Something blows by him, going much faster! \"What in the hell could be going faster than my Ferrari?\" The young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 250 mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 275 mph. Whoooooosssshhhhh! He's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again! Dumbfounded, the banker floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again! The Ferrari red lines and there's nothing more he can do! Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end. The young man stops and jumps out, and unbelievably, the old man is still alive. He runs up to the mangled old man and says, \"Oh my God! Is there anything I can do for you?\" The old man whispers with his dying breath... \"Unhook... My... Suspenders... From... Your...

The old rooster sees it strutting around and gets a little worried. \"So they're tryna replace me, eh?\" The old rooster thinks. \"I'll show them!\" It walks up to the new bird and says, \"so you think you're the new stud in town? I bet you really think you're hot stuff don't you? Well, I'm not ready for the chopping block yet.

You're on, and since I'm so great you can even have a half a lap headstart and I'll still win easy!\" So the two roosters head over to the hen house to start the race with all the hens gathering to watch. The race begins and all the hens start cheering the old rooster on. After the first lap, he's still maintaining his lead. However, with each lap the old rooster lets it slip a little as the new guy catches up. It's the seventh lap and each rooster is frantically sprinting, with the old rooster just barely leading. By now, the farmer has heard all the commotion. He grabs his gun and runs into the barnyard, figuring a fox or something is after his chickens. When he gets there, he sees the two roosters running around the hen house with the old one still lightly in the lead as they near the last lap. The farmer takes aim with his shotgun and blows the young rooster to smithereens.

He looks around and sees lots of dildos, sex dolls, vibrators and etc, but nothing that would keep his wife occupied for 3 weeks. So he asks the clerk, who happens to be the store owner, and though at first the clerk says there is nothing there that would keep a person satisfied for that long, after some badgering, he finally pulls a black ebony box with a gold clasp from underneath the counter -- all the while assuring the newlywed that it's not for sale, being a family heirloom and of priceless sentimental value. He opens the box, and inside is an apparently normal dildo. The newlywed guy is unimpressed, but the clerk interrupts. \"Let me demonstrate,\" he says. He looks at the box and says, \"Voodoo Dick -- The Door!\" And the voodoo dick jumps into the air, floats over to the door, and starts going at the keyhole like crazy, pounding away until the door begins to crack down the center. Finally, the clerk says, \"Voodoo Dick -- The Box!\" And the voodoo dick flies back into the box. With some difficulty, the guy convinces the clerk to sell it to him. When he arrives home, he gives his wife the box and says, \"Just open it and say, 'voodoo dick, my pussy' if you ever get horny, all right?\" So he leaves on his business trip, and by the third day, the wife is getting pretty horny. So she opens the box and says, \"Voodoo dick, my pussy,\" thinking the whole thing rather rediculous. After about 15 minutes, she has had several orgasms and is starting to get tired, so she tries to pull the voodoo dick out. Apparently, her husband had forgotten to tell her how to turn it off. So she puts on a dress and starts driving to the hospital. About half way there, the voodoo dick is pumping away at her, and she starts multiple orgasming, and so she swerves a bit over the yellow line. A police officer happens to be behind her, and pulls her over. As the cop stands at the window, she is sweating and her face is blushed, and she's squirming all over as the voodoo dick goes at her. The cop looks at her for a second and says, \"Lady, how many drinks have you had tonight?\" She says quickly, \"Officer, I swear I haven't had anything to drink! There's this voodoo dick going at my pussy and I can't make it stop! I'm on the way to the hospital to have it removed!\" The officer thinks about it for a second, gives her a smirk and says, \"Voodoo Dick my ass, lady.\"",

That'll make some noise for sure!\" So the men throw the huge log into the hole. As they're waiting for a sound a goat suddenly busts through the treeline running as fast as it can towards the hole! When the goat reaches the hole, it jumps up in the air and goes straight down into the hole. As the two men were standing there in shock as to what just happened, a farmer walked into the clearing. The farmer asked the guys, \"What are you two doing out here?\" The men explained the whole thing that just happened with the goat. The farmer scratches his head and said, \"Hmmm, yep that is pretty unusual. Well no worries, I know that it wasn't my goat. You see, I keep my goat tied up to a huge log.\"",

He looked at the pig and said, \"Yeah I fancy the pig, I could fuck the pig!\" However when he approaches the pig the dog jumps in his way snarling and snapping at him, blocking him from getting close to the pig. \"Damn it,\" says the man and he retreats to his shelter, his lust defeated. Life goes on as normal for a while, he climbs trees, breaks cocunuts and swims in the sea. Then a few weeks later the man gets the horn again. He looks at the dog, \"nah I don't fancy the dog,\" he says. He looks at the pig and, \"Yeah, I fancy the pig, I could do the pig!\" He tries again to fuck the pig. But again the dog jumps to the pigs defense, snarling and biting, not letting the man near the pig. \"Fuck it, bloody dog,\" says the man and retires to his shelter, his lust defeated. He goes on for a few weeks much as before living the simple life, he creates fire, improves his shelter and smashes rocks for fun. Then once again comes the unstoppable urge. The man looks at the dog, \"Nah I don't fancy the dog,\" he says. He looks at the pig, \"yes I fancy the pig, I could do the pig,\" he says, and once again he tries to fuck the pig. However again the dog jumps to the defense of the pig, gnashing and snarling and the man is beaten and returns to his shelter his lust defeated. A few days later he's walking along the beach when to his surprise he discovers the body of a young woman. He pulls her out of the sea and carries her to his shelter. She's unconscious at first but he feeds her and gives her water and after a week she is nursed back to health. \"You know you really helped me,\" says the woman. \"Really?\" Said the man. \"Yes, without you I would have died on that beach,\" she said. \"So infact I owe you my life.\" Then... Suggestively touching her swimsuit she says, \"You've been stuck on this island a time right? It must get lonely here? Is there any thing I can do for you?\" \"Well,\" says the man after some consideration. \"There is one thing... Can you take the dog for a walk!\"",

They check into their hotel and are furious when they find out that the lifts wont be working for another month and that their room is located on the 90th floor. The old men who tire very easily from walking too long, are told their deposit is non-refundable but will receive $150 off their $1,000 accommodation, due to the lifts being out of service and so they grab their keys and muble their disgust at the receptionist. They leave their bags at the reception, where the bell boy insists to carry their luggage for them to their room, while they stroll the town.

Looking up at the hellish task that awaits them of 90 floors, the men take deep breaths and begin their journey. Step after step, the pain grows, and they are only up to the 11th floor. They reach the 30th floor after an hour and decide to have a break for 10 minutes. They then climb another 30 floors and reach the 60th floor, when they decide to have another beak, this time for 20 minutes. Finally after 4 hours, they reach the last step of the 89th floor and Michael says to john; \"Hey I got some good news and bad news, which do you want first?\" John replies, \"gimme the good news.\" Michael replies, \"we only got 1 step left and then we have made it.\" John replies, \"Hey that is good news!

Ron was not the easiest guy to talk to, but I was curious as to why he would be fishing alone on his honeymoon. So I said, \"Hi Ron. Surprised to see you out here today.

Sometimes he changes it like for the New Years he sets it as the year, or Christmas time when he changes it to the date, but it's late fall right now so there he has it set as the regular code. Although once he decided to be a little generous, he got a new heating system for the office, it's a little screwy sometimes, you turn the heat on but it never actually turns on. But the heaters came with new thermostats, these show the date and the time on them. There are only three other guys in the office, Tim, he's just a weird one, he asks about what kind of stamps we buy, I don't like him much. Then there is some gay guy. I can't remember his name, he's not exactly a vibrant person, he blends in to the office like he is part of it. Lastly there is an old guy, he's been in the office for decades now, I think he might just be dead and no one ever checked, I have never seen that man leave his office chair. Right now, we are all working overtime, I think I might have forgotten to go home last night, I can't remember. There was a big crisis back at HQ and now we are stuck with the paperwork. I really don't know what day it is. Suddenly that old guy yells over, \"Turn up the heat!\" I don't blame him, it's freezing, must be that new heating. After he sees me get up he decides to go be unproductive somewhere else by taunting the other guys. I walk over to the thermostat, I figure I should see what time it is, since I don't remember sleeping. It's nine o'clock on a Saturday. The regular code, I punch it right in.

My wife and I prepare the fish together, and I play with my kids. In the evening, I cook a few meals for some extra money so I can go fishing again.\" The businessman scoffs and cuts the air with his hand. \"You have it all wrong, mi amigo! Here's what you need to do: First, hire a bunch of others to do your fishing for you. You and your wife get cooking all day, everyday. Make a name for yourself and hire more people to sell your product to all the restaurants in the area until you're a local name. Then open your own place, work hard day and night and make it a success then open another and another, delegating and training more people to take over sections of the business. Grow and expand into other towns, invest in advertising, eventually open up a franchise and go international! At the height of your business, sell it! You'll make a fortune.\" The local waits for the translation, thinks carefully, then asks, \"and what would I do with this fortune?\" The businessman laughs and replies, \"Whatever you want!

All was peaceful until around 4PM when Interstate 95 runs in during rush hour, \"MOVE OUT OF THE WAY BITCH I'M IN A HURRY.\" \"FUGGIN MAKE EM YA BASTARD,\" and the two hammer away at each other. The two go at it for a few minutes, but the highway could not keep up with the fury of hundreds of short-tempered drivers that had just been cut off. The interstate grabs the highway, \"GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY ASS,\" and tosses him where the 2-way street was nursing his headwound. The interstate claims victory, finishes his beer and says, \"QUICK BARTENDER, GIMME SOME VODKA.\" The interstate begins to down vodka by the handle. Halfway through the 3rd handle of vodka, the Autobahn walks in, \"Out of my way, you puny little piece of asphalt.\" The Autobahn grabs his gun and puts 6 rounds into the interstate. He sits down and tells the bartender, \"I want the blood of my enemies mixed with your hardest rum on the rocks, shaken, not stirred.\" The bartender squeezes out some of the interstate's blood from an open gunshot wound and uses the bullets for ice. He mixes it with rum and serves it to the autobahn. But before the autobahn can pick up his drink, a little dirt bike trail walks in. The autobahn says, \"Ha, I suppose you're gonna make me move out of my chair?\" The trail starts screaming and grabs the autobahn by his head and rips him limb from limb. With a guttural cry of victory the little bike trail runs out. At this point, the highway has recovered sufficiently to ask the street, \"Gee what's his problem?\" The street replies, \"Oh him? He's a cycle path.\"",

He heads over to the air force, they tell him it's not going to happen but maybe he'll have better luck with the navy. He tries them and gets told that they are desperate but not THAT desperate, he should go try his luck with the Army. So he heads over to the army recruiters and sure enough, they sign him right up.

But as the week rolls on, the dares slowly get worse as each of the cowboys try to win the battle. As they entered town, one stinking of manure and looking to one up his friend, they decide to go to the saloon for a drink. And he sees it, a dirty old spittoon sitting under the bar, glistening in the evening light. \"Hey Kevin,\" he proclaims, \"I dare you to drink the contents of that spittoon there.\" Kevin, not looking to be called a wuss quickly accepts and struts over to the spittoon. He grabs it and has to peel if off the floor, leaving a spot that hasn't seen sunlight for years. He takes a quick whiff to see what he's getting into and dry heaves. But he quickly pulls himself together, cleans some dried spit off the rim with his sleeve, puts his lips to the rim and tilts his head back. At this point the smell hits the whole saloon, just straight purification, clearing most of the clientele out, covering their mouths and seeking fresh air. Joe begins gulping down the contents, heaving and convulsing after every swallow, letting excess run down his chin and chest. Down his front is just this rotten, pussy, brown and black swirled slime, with chunks of chew and butts falling and splatting on the floor. After a minute of this his friend eyes watering and mouth dropped open comes to with a fresh whiff of rancid eggs. He heaves and cries, \"Kevin, stop, that's enough, you win! I can't stand it anymore, you have to stop.\" At this point, Kevin tips his head back farther and starts drinking more, letting more pussy sludge run around the edge of the spittoon. His friend seeing this looses it and runs outside to vomit. Five minutes later Kevin comes outside, green in face, empty spittoon in hand, and completely soiled with rotten mucus and spittle. Everyone in town is crowded around the entrance to the saloon curious about what was happening, covering their mouths trying to protect themselves from the disease the man is radiating. His friend slowly stands up, cleaning the vomit from his mouth and asks, \"Why didn't you stop? I said you won.\" Kevin looks his friend square in the eyes and flatly responds, \"It was all one piece.\"",

You know, multi-colored hair, tats and piercings, and dresses like it's constantly at a rave. The only thing in the world a Trid gives a damn about is having fun. That's it. If it's not fun, a Trid simply isn't interested. Well, one day a Trid happens to be walking through the forest, trying to figure out something fun to do. He was bored, and boredom is worse than hard labor to a Trid. As he's walking along, he spots a rabbit a little ways ahead of him. \"Hmm, it might be fun to chase that rabbit.\" The little Trid thought to himself, so he took off running towards the rabbit. The rabbit takes one look at the Trid running towards him, and bolts away at top speed. The Trid starts laughing and pours on the speed, trying as hard as he can to catch up to the rabbit. \"Oh, what fun!\" The little Trid exclaimed, as he dashed after the rabbit around trees, and over rocks. Suddenly the rabbit hooked a mad turn and started up a tall hill, running like the wind. At the top of this hill, a goblin happened to be dozing in the warm sunshine. The rabbit was moving so fast, he ran over the goblin without even seeing him. Waking up startled, the goblin looks down the hill to see the Trid coming at him at full steam. So, he waits until the Trid reaches the top of the hill... And he kicks him! Down the hill the Trid went rolling and bouncing, head over heels, to land in a heap at the bottom. Picking himself up, he squeals with delight. Being kicked down the hill was the most fun he had ever had, and he went running back up the hill, where the goblin once again kicked him back down. Over a dozen times the Trid ran up the hill, and over a dozen times he was kicked back down, each time being more fun than the last. He was getting ready to run up again, when a sudden thought occurred to him; This would be even more fun with more Trids! So he high-tailed it back to Trid village to let everyone know about the hill and the goblin. Soon, there were dozens of Trids at the hill. They would run up one side of the hill, and the goblin would kick them down the other side. Meanwhile, the rabbit that the first Trid had been chasing was wondering what had happened to his playmate. He had been enjoying the chase as much as the Trid had, and he went to see what had happened. He came back to the hill and saw the line of Trids and the goblin kicking them. Shrugging he shoulders, he got in line and followed the Trids up the side of the hill. When he got to the top however, the goblin just stood there staring at him. \"What's wrong?\" The rabbit asked, \"Why won't you kick me down the hill?\" The goblin shook his head and said, \"Silly rabbit, kicks are for Trids!\"",

Many people go by, look at both beggars, but only put money into the hat of the beggar sitting behind the Cross. The Pope comes by. He stops to watch the throngs of people giving money to the beggar who holds the Cross while none give to the beggar holding the Star of David. Finally, the Pope approaches the beggar with the Star of David and says, \"My poor fellow, don't you understand? This is a Catholic country; This city is the seat of Catholicism. People aren't going to give you money if you sit there with a Star of David in front of you, especially when you're sitting beside a beggar who is holding a Cross. In fact, they would probably give more money to him just out of spite.\" The beggar with the Star of David listened to the Pope, smiled, and turned to the beggar with the Cross and said, \"Jignessbhai, look who's trying to teach the Patel brothers about bijness!\"",

He informed mall security and they escorted him to the control booth so he would look at the surveillance cameras to try to spot the guilty canine. The mall security looked and looked at footage while Roy had some coffee someone had offered him out of pity. Well, finally, the security guard thought he saw the culprit on screen in another part of the mall.

You see that girl over there?\" Asks the old man with his rifle aimed at the girls direction. The guys look over with wide eyes and jaws dropped at the direction of a hot, young, blonde girl wearing a crop top plaid shirt, and daisy dukes, standing by the kitchens enterance. \"That's my promiscuous daughter. You boys gotta agree you ain't gon' try to do anything with her, or I will shoot your dicks off!\" Exclaimed the old man with his rifle now pointing at their dicks. \"I'm gonna cover my daughters pussy with glitter, and check y'alls dicks in the mornin' to make sure y'all stayed true to y'alls word.\" The old man said. They nod their head in agreement and walk into the house. The daughter prepares a small meal for the guys and goes off to her room. The old man then shows the three guys over to their room and reminds them of their agreement. He closes the door to their room and walks next door to his daughters room with a bag of glitter and gives her a good night kiss before heading to his room. A couple hours pass in the night. The white guy gets up to use the bathroom. He comes back 30 minutes later. 1 5 minutes later, the brown guys gets up to use the bathroom. He returns an hour later. 30 minutes go by, and the black guy gets up to use the bathroom. He is gone for over 2 hours before returning to bed. Morning comes and the old man walks in the room with his rifle, and wakes the guys up. \"Alright boys, get up and line up!\" The guys get up, and oblige to his command. He points his rifle at the white guy, and says, \"Drop them pants, boy!\" The white guy drops his pants and reveals a glittered dick. BOOM! The old man shoots him in the dick, and the white guy runs out the house, screaming in pain. He cocks his gun and points it at the brown guy. \"Let's see your dick, boy!\" The brown guy, nervous and shaking, drops his pants to reveal a glittered covered dick. BOOM! The old man blasts the brown guy right in the dick, and he goes running out the door, crying in pain. He points at the black guy and tells him, \"Your turn!\" With a big grin on his face. The black guy, sweating and trembling, drops his pants. To the old mans surprise, there was no glitter on his dick. \"Well, I'll be damned! You're one of the good men that stays true to his word! Good job, boy, I'm proud of ya!\" The black guy wipes sweat from his forehead, says thank you to the old man, and smiles at him with a mouthful of glitter.",

She prays devoutly every night before going to sleep, and one day an angel appears in her dreams and instructs her to go to the next town over, and seek the midget who lives there. \"Once you find him propose marriage to him. He will say no, and each time he does, you will instantly grow 3 inches.\" The girl, skeptical but still more desperate, seeked the midget the next day. Indeed there he was, short, stout and with a mean grimace smeared like peanut butter from jaw to jaw, and once the girl asked for his hand in marriage he yelped a defiant, \"No!\" And marched off in a huff. And wouldn't you know it, the girl had, indeed, grown three inches. Ecstatic from the results, she revisited the midget the next day, and the next, each time boldly rejected with a simply, \"No!\" But growing another six inches for her trouble. Now standing at a proud 5 foot 9, the girl pondered whether she should make one last visit. Her height was now certainly more than adequate, but what she truly longed was to have a grand physique, to be statuesque.

I'm telling you, the public's never gonna go for it.\" A year later Jimmy informed him that things at the factory were going very well. \"Come on up and check it out, Dad,\" he urged. \"Oh, and by the way, you were right about that ad campaign.

It has also given rise to many unusual events. Last September one of the star attractions, Arnold, an Indonesian ape, escaped to the dismay of the zoo director. The matter was a serious one because the members of the staff of the zoo, while expert at caring for animals, had had no experience whatever in rounding them up or capturing them. The zoo director appealed to the office of the mayor for help and the secretary to the mayor asked, \"Have you looked in the yellow pages?\" The director said he hadn't, but would, immediately. To his surprise, under, \"animal capturing service,\" he found a listing for the Acme Ape Apprehenders. He called them immediately Within 20 minutes a panel truck arrived at the admin office of the zoo and a small man emerged and rushed to the director who was waiting at the door. \"Is there a wooded area in the vicinity?\" The little man asked. The director said there was, within one half mile from the zoo. \"Hop in the truck,\" the little man said. The director did and they drove off. Minutes later they arrived at a small grove and immediately spotted Arnold on a branch about 25 feet above the ground. The two men got out, went to the back of the truck and the little man opened the door. An excited little dog jumped out and began running around in circles. The little man reached into the truck and took out a suicase which he opened. In the suitcase were a pair of handcuffs, which he handed to the zoo director, a sawed off shotgun, which he leaned against the trunk of the tree, and a baseball bat. \"Now,\" the little man said, \"I'm going up into the tree with the baseball bat, and I'm going to knock the ape out of the tree. The instant the ape hits the ground the dog, well trained, will grab the ape by the crotch. The ape, instantly and instinctively will grab at his crotch with both hands. And you snap the handcuffs on and we've got him. The zoo director, pointing to the shotgun leaning against the tree, said.\" I'm not too sure about this, what's the gun for? \"The little man said,\" Look, I'm an expert. I know what I'm doing and things will go just fine, after all, I have the baseball bat. I know my job and it'll never happen but if the ape should, by any chance, knock ME out of the tree,.",

So Jonah and Channing take off to look for the fruit while Justin just sits there whimpering. \"Well?\" Shia the chief says to Justin. Get out there little girl and join your companions or ill eat you now. Justin replies, \"but its scary out there...\" Shia furiously says JUST DO IT! Justin then ran off into the jungle in search of the 10 fruit. As justin and jonah are still searching channing makes its back and shows shia the fruit he collected. Shia says ah I see you've collected the fruit, 10 apples I see. Yes channing replies I'm free to go now right? No not quite shia replies you have one more task you must insert all the fruit into your ass. WHAT?!?! Channing replies... YES Shia says it must be done every last fruit or you will be eaten on the spot. Fuck... 10 apples.. Channing starts off with one and fails on the second so hes eaten... Jonah then returns with 10 cherries and is also told to do the same. Jonah begins with 1 cherry.. Hmm not to bad he says so he manages 2.3. 4.5. 6.7. 8.9 and then just bursts into uncontrollable laughter as he was going to insert the last cherry so fails the task and he is also eaten alive.. So in heaven Channing and Jonah are talking and Channing says so dude why didn't you finish with the last cherry you could have made it back home.. Jonah replies I know I know but I couldn't help it dude I saw Justin running into the village excited as fuck carrying 10 pineapples!",

He is taken to a clearing with 3 identical huts. The chief says, \"In the first hut is 6 bottles of the finest Russian vodka, drink them all in an hour. After that, in the second hut, there is a lion that has not eaten for days because he has a bad toothache. You need to remove the tooth using only your hands and you only have an hour. In the last hut there is a woman from the village who has never been satisfied sexually. You have only an hour to satisfy her.\" The pilot, just thinking about survival rushes into the first hut. To everyone's amazement an empty bottle of vodka is tossed out every 10 minutes. An hour goes by and the pilot stumbles out of the hut completely drunk. After a couple of tries he eventually makes it into the second hut. Almost instantly the lion starts roaring and the pilot starts screaming. This goes on for about a half hour then it goes silent. A few minutes later the pilot stumbles out, claw marks all overn and clothes just covered in blood.

The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, RayBan sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, \"If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?\" Bud looks at the man, who obviously is a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, \"Sure, why not?\" The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Macbook Air, tethers it to his Galaxy S3 and uses its built-in GPS function to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to a NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo. The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany... Within seconds, he receives an email on his Android that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Macbook Air, after a few minutes, receives a response. Finally, he simply opens the spreadsheet on his laptop, turns to the cowboy and says, \"You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.\" \"That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,\" says Bud. He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car. Then Bud says to the young man, \"Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?\" The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, \"Okay, why not?\" \"You're a Congressman for the U. S. Government,\" says Bud. \"Wow! That's correct,\" says the yuppie, \"but how did you guess that?\" \"No guessing required.\" Answered the cowboy. \"You showed up here even though nobody called you; You want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked. You used millions of dollars worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; And you don't know a thing about how working people make a living - or about cows, for that matter.

Maximilian Steel was a space-criminal, one of the biggest scumbags in Andromeda-9 since the arrest of the notorious gangster Forty-Eyes. Steel was known for holding up large transportation shuttles and demanding ransom. It was no surprise that after years of dodging the Intergalactic Police Force, Steel managed to develop a hefty amount of money. On July 4,3055, Steel revealed a massive construct the size of the Moon, on it was a weapon with great concentrated power that could destroy a planet. The weapon was pointed at the capital of the Milky Way galaxy -- Earth-6, a behemoth, terraformed Jupiter, the center of governance and knowledge in the galaxy. Steel broadcasted to this massive planet, and demanded 300 trillion quarsecs or else the entire planet would be decimated. Helpless to do anything, the planet gave into Steel's demands and decided to give him all the money. Steel, being the scum that he was, fired his massive weapon anyways. The massive weapon was a beam of pure concentrated plutonium, with a power to destroy the planet in 30 minutes. The planet's military was in a panic, scrambling fighter ships and sending them in the hopes of destroying the weapon before it could do more damage. One fighter by the name of Jet had the idea of making the plutonium beam impact another object in space before reaching Earth-6. He thought of sending his fuel-cells in the line of the weapon, burning the plutonium in process and causing an explosion in space. Jet shot up into space, with the plutonium mass approaching him at a high speed. Jet threw his fuel-cells at the plutonium, but it's far too much power for the cells to handle... Jet's fuel can't melt Steel's beam.",

When asked what he'd like for his last meal, he replied simply with, \"A banana, if you will.\" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. The conductor ate the banana in regular fashion and braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen. However, after the electricity was activated, nothing happened to the conductor. The prison guard was shocked and, not knowing what to do, simply let him go unscathed. In a few days, the conductor was back to work. A few days after his return to the train business, he managed to derail yet another train, again killing nearly a hundred people but surviving the crash. As before, he was trialed and found guilty of mass murder. Again, he was sentenced to death by electric chair. It was the same prison guard as before. He was surprised to see the conductor again but held his tongue, for the man was about to die and it would be rude to question him. \"What would you like for your last meal, sir?\" The conductor respond as he did last time: \"A banana, if you will.\" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. The conductor ate the banana in regular fashion and braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen. The electricity was activated and the conductor was prepared. But, as before, the conductor was unhurt. The prison guard checked for any malfunctions but found nothing, not believing the entire situation was possible. In shock as before and not knowing what to do, the guard let the conductor go. The conductor was, against all odds, alive and was still allowed to continue his job as a train conductor even though he was responsible for the death of almost two hundred people. He was thankful to be allowed to continue his job but also scared. He would try not carefully from now on. However, this idea didn't help much as on the first train he was conducting after the chair, he managed to somehow crash yet another train. He was the only survivor of the train, which contained over a hundred people. He was trialed and, again, found guilty of the murder of over a hundred people. He was sentenced to death by electric chair. The prison guard was the same, the surprise was the same, the procedure was the same. After giving the banana to the conductor, the guard was silent. He couldn't bring himself to say anything, all he could do was prepare the chair. The man sat in the chair, expecting death. The guard activated it and, again, the conductor was unscathed. The prison guard couldn't contain himself. He simply had to ask, \"Sir, how did you manage to crash a train 3 times? And how did you survive the chair 3 times? Did the banana have something to do with it?\" The conductor responds with: \"No, I suppose I'm just not a good conductor.\"",

The bartender surprisingly looks at him and says: \"Aren't you a piece of string?\" The 1st piece of string replies, \"Why yes I am sir. I just need a nice cold beer.\" \"I'm afraid we don't serve to strings,\" the bartender replied. The 1st piece of string strolls out. The 2nd piece of string sees this and gets discouraged, but decides he will still give it a shot. The 2nd piece decides to go into the bar anyway and proceeds to ask the bartender for a beer. The bartender, now even more confused, asks the 2nd string the same question: \"Aren't you a piece of string? I'm afraid I cannot serve a piece of string,\" the bartender informs the 2nd string with a regretful reply. The 2nd piece of string expected this and strolls out of the bar, beerless and sad. The 3rd piece of string has seen both his friends rejected, but is DYING for a beer. He had a long day and gets a light bulb idea. String 3 decides he's going to throw a little disguise. He decides to tie himself in a knot, ruffle up the ends of his knot a bit, and get the string look out as much as possible. After being satisfied with his disguise he puffs out his chest and walks into the bar. Instantly, the bartender sees right through his disguise. The 3rd string walks up to the bar anyway: \"I'll take an ice cold beer please,\" string 3 claims confidently. \"Aren't you just a string, like both of your other friends?,\" Quickly replies the bartender. \"No sir, I'm a frayed knot.\"",

Quite little known however, is the Roman equivalent of Achilles, Bophadee. The stories are similar. His mother dipped him in the river of the underworld to ensure his immortality, save for the one spot from which she held him. He became a great warrior, fighting in some of the most crucial battles, rising through the ranks of command. And just like Achilles, Bophadee had a weakness.

Looking around at the women occupying it, he decides he has a shot. Hours go by, being shot down by all he tried he returns to the bar. Bartender walks over and asks him what he will have, to which he responds he can't afford any. Asking, \"Damn it man, I've never been to a bar I couldn't manage a free drink out of a women.\" Bartender begins to laugh and explains the bar is pretty much all married ladies and there blue collar plant working husbands. Bartender: I tell you what buddy, if you can make our mascot that donkey over there laugh, I'll let you drink the entire night for free. The man looks over when a moment of inspiration hits him, what's the worst that happens the donkey doesn't laugh? The man walks over and simply whispers in the donkey's ear. As the bartender watches in amazement the donkey rolls over seemingly, \"ahh eee ahhing,\" to death. The man walks back over and tells the bartender, \"I'll take a knobb creak and a budweiser. Keep em coming.\" The bartender being a man of his word pays his debt, and the gentleman drinks the night away on the house. The following night the gentleman returns, and asks the bartender if the bet still stands. Bartender: I'll make the bet with ya, but this time make him cry. I don't mean calling and acting an ass, I mean legitimately crying. Gentleman: You've got yourself a bet. The gentleman walks off towards the mascot, with more confidence then should be allowed for such a silly bet. He stands in front of the donkey, back to the bar, fumbling in his pockets seemingly. The bartender concerned he is digging for a weapon runs over to stop the man. By the time he arrives the donkey has laid himself down, tears welling from its eyes and looking as if he had lost the will to live. Gentleman: I guess I won the bet again. Bartender: So it seems you did. Both walk back to the bar, the bartender more then confused how Dr. Doolittle here has managed these feats. Bartender: I'm a man of my word, but I'm honestly not gonna pay up this time unless you answer a couple questions. Gentleman: Sure, you've been more then a good sport. Bartender: How in the fuck did you make that donkey laugh? Gentleman: Well, it was easy. I walked up, took a quick study of the donkey, and whispered in his ear, \"Mines bigger.\" The bartender now laughing himself, asks, \"Ok, well how in the hell did you make him cry?\" Gentleman: Now that was even easier.

However, their manager got the dates wrong and the group ended up doing a three-day run in an outdoor theater in Albuquerque in the middle of the July heat. The event was exhausting and by the third night, everyone was just hoping to survive one more concert and move on. During the last song - Beethoven's Ninth - the bass players in the back of the orchestra hatch a plan. There's a bit in the middle of the song that's all violins and flutes, surely they won't be missed. They decide to sneak out to the bar next door for a drink, 'just to keep hydrated.' They stay a little longer than they should have, and drink a lot more than they would have, when one of them realizes that they are going to miss their entrance. The ring-leader of the group tells them to not worry, as he had the foresight to tie the last page of the score down with a bit of string. It will take the conductor a while to unite it, which means the concert will stop and they can sneak in. They drunkingly congratulate him for being so smart as they stumble back to the theater. Meanwhile, the conductor is in a bind. The very energetic end of the piece is coming up and his bass section is missing. The violinists are working up a sweat trying to keep up in the heat when suddenly the first violinist faints from heat exhaustion. This is the last straw for the second violinist and she faints too. The bass section begins stumbling in not so subtly as they are knocking people, instruments, and chairs over. To top it all off, someone has tied down the last page of the score as he is desperately trying to flip the page. It would do us good to sympathize with the conductor and put ourselves in his shoes. From his vantage point, he begins to realize that: There are two out, at the end of the ninth The score is tied And the basses are loaded.",

You're the seventh minor I've found in this bar tonight.\" E-Flat comes back the next night in a three-piece suit with nicely shined shoes. THe bartender says, \"You're looking sharp tonight. Come on in, this could be a major development.\" Sure enough, E-Flat soon takes off his suit and everything else, and is au natural. Eventually C sobers up and realises in horror that he's under a rest. C is brought to trial, found guilty of contributing to the dimunation of a minor, and is sentenced to 10 years at an upscale correctional facility. On appeal, however, C is found innocent of any wrongdoing, even accidental. The judge rules that all contrary motions are bassless.",

The lion's team received. They were able to get two first downs and then had to punt. The mule punted and the rhino was back deep for the kick. He caught the ball, lowered his head and charged. First, he crushed a roadrunner, then two rabbits. He gored a wildebeast, knocked over two cows, and broke through to daylight, scoring six. Unfortunately, they lacked a placekicker, and the score remained 6 - 0. Late in the first half the lion's team scored a touchdown and the mule kicked the extra point. The lion's team led at halftime 7 - 6. In the locker room, the lion gave a peptalk. \"Look you guys. We can win this game. We've got the lead and they only have one real threat. We've got to keep the ball away from the rhino, he's a killer. Mule, when you kick off be sure to keep it away from the rhino.\" The second half began. Just as the mule was about to kick off, the rhino's team changed formation and the ball went directly to the rhino. Once again, the rhino lowered his head and was off running. First, he stomped two gazelles. He skewered a zebra, and bulldozed an elephant out of the way. It looked like he was home free. Suddenly at the twenty yard line, he dropped over dead. There were no other animals in sight anywhere near him. The lion went over to see what had happened. Right next to the dead rhino he saw a small centipede. \"Did you do this?\" He asked the centipede. \"Yeah, I did.\" The centipede replied.

The Catholic is first. When the gates to Catholic Heaven open, they sees a less-than-ideal heaven. The Catholic says, \"God, you have taught me to be thankful for all that I have. I know that I should be thankful for what you give me in salvation.\" The Lutheran is next. The doors to Lutheran Heaven open up, and a place filled with happy people, but with homes of mud and clothes made of rags. The Lutheran says, \"God, I you have taught me to be thankful for everyone I have. I know that this is the true meaning of salvation.\" The Protestant is last. The doors to Protestant heaven open up to reveal a heaven that is absolutely perfect, to ones wildest dreams, but the entirety of it is covered in animal feces. The Protestant says, \"God, you have taught me to be strict and righteous. This is insulting and I believe you have forsaken me.\" St. Peter smiles at the three of them and says: \"That was a test of faith. Heaven is just past me.\" He looks at the Protestant. \"As for you, we realize that our test was decieving, but we know you have been a good person. So we are testing this idea: An imperfect heaven for those not perfectly faithful. Welcome to Lutheran heaven!\"",

Therefore, they go to church and hire a priest who is kind of into this stuff. In order to convince him, the board introduce themselves as religious people. One week after, priest comes back with a video: Lots of men with helmets and shit are gathered in the middle of nowhere and one of them appears to be banging a nail into something. When the camera closes up, we see that the guys are roman soldiers and the one in the middle is crucifying Jesus Christ. He turns to the camera and says: \"Wilson nails, so strong!\" The board finds this ad extremely offensive and politely tells the priest that they don't want to see cross and jesus in their ads. The next week, our priest comes with another video: Hundreds of men with helmet and shit are gathered around the Eiffel Tower. One banging a nail onto the tower. When the camera zooms in, we see that he crucifies Jesus Christ onto Eiffel Tower. He turns to the camera and says, \"Wilson Nails! Very effective! Even on metal!\" The board gets angry and politely says that he does not want any fucking crucifying in a fucking nail ad. The priest, for the last time brings another video a week after: The video starts. Nothing happens. Only a desert... Then, a man appears with beard and long hair. He screams and runs with blood all over himself. A few seconds later, shitloads of roman guys appear on the screen running as fast as they could.

Now the fly noticed that if it moved about three inches down the leaf it would catch some mist off the pond, and cool down a bit. Now in the pond there was a Fish, and the fish noticed that if the fly moved down about three inches, it would be able to jump up out of the water and eat the fly. Now next to the pond behind a tree there was a Bear, and the bear noticed that if the fly moved down about three inches, the fish would jump out of the water to get the fly and the bear could come out from behind the tree and catch the fish for dinner. Now across from the pond eating a cheese sandwich was a Hunter, and the hunter noticed that if the fly moved down about three inches, the fish would jump out of the water to get the fly and the bear would come out from behind the tree to catch the fish and the hunter could drop his cheese sandwich and shoot the bear. Now in a log next to the hunter was a mouse, and the mouse noticed that if the fly moved down about three inches, the fish would jump out of the water to get the fly and the bear would come out from behind the tree to catch the fish and the hunter would drop his cheese sandwich to shoot the bear and the mouse could come out of his log to get the cheese sandwich. Now behind the log there was a Cat, and the cat noticed that if the fly moved down about three inches, the fish would jump out of the water to get the fly and the bear would come out from behind the tree to catch the fish and the hunter would drop his cheese sandwich to shoot the bear and the mouse would come out of its log to eat the cheese sandwich and the cat could jump out from behind the log to get the mouse. SO, sure enough, the Fly moves down about three inches, the Fish jumpes out of the water, the Bear comes out from behind the tree, the Hunter droppes his sandwich, the Mouse comes out of the log, the Cat jumpes over the log to get the Mouse and misses and falls in the pond.

His dad thought for a while and answered, \"Look at it this way: I'm the president, your mom is Congress, your maid is the work force, you are the people and your baby brother is the future.\" \"I still don't get it,\" responded the Little Johnny. \"Why don't you sleep on it then? Maybe you'll understand it better,\" said the dad. \"Okay then... Good night,\" said Little Johnny went off to bed. In the middle of the night, Little Johnny was awakened by his baby brother's crying. He went to his baby brother's crib and found that his baby brother had taken a crap in his diaper. So Little Johnny went to his parent's room to get help. When he got to his parent's bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep. Through the keyhole he saw his mom loudly snoring, buthis dad wasn't there. So he went to the maid's room. When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid. Little Johnny was surprised, but then he just realized something and thinks aloud, \"OH! Now I understand the government!

The first guy goes in, and after a few minutes, he comes out with white skin, kakhi slacks, a polo, and a golf cap. They laugh and admire his new race for a minute. Then the second guy says, \"How bout that penny?\" The first guy yells, \"GET A JOB!\"",

            "joke": "A man and his motorcycle: A man has been saving up money for months to buy a motorcycle. He goes to a vintage bike store near his house. Regretfully, the storeowner tells him that none of his inventory falls within our hero's price range. Just as the man, sullen and defeated, turns to leave, the storeowner remembers something. \"Wait. I do have one bike I can sell you. The only catch is there are some exposed wires. It runs fine. Just make sure you rub some vaseline on the wires when it rains.\" The man buys the bike. He is elated. That night, he goes to his girlfriend's parents' house for dinner. Before they make the door, she tells him to remember one thing: \"Don't talk at the dinner table. The first person to talk at the dinner table has to do the dishes.\" \"That's no problem,\" the man says. \"I'm happy to do the dishes.\" His girlfriend shoots him a foreboding look. When they walk into the house, the man is greeted with a pungent, formidable scent. It is then that he notices that the house is lined floor-to-ceiling with moldy, disgusting, months-old dishes. He decides that something must be done. Ten minutes into dinner, the man puts down his silverware. He proceeds to grab his girlfriend, throw her onto the table, tear off all her clothes, and ruthlessly pipe her out in front of both her parents. Once he is done, he glances at his girlfriend's father. Dad is clearly infuriated but says nothing. The meal continues. Another ten minutes pass and the man grabs his girlfriend's mother and repeats the task. Gives it to her in the strictest of biblical senses. Again, he looks at dad. Dad is beet red, seemingly read to pulverize the man. But he says nothing. They continue to eat. Suddenly, a great burst of thunder peals out and it begins to rain torrentially. \"Oh, shit, I need some Vaseline!\" The man exclaims. Dad recoils and raises his hands. \"That's OK. I'll do the dishes.\"",

            "joke": "A Baseball Tale: Was he the best pitcher that ever threw a baseball? Back in the 1950s, there were a lot of folks who thought so. Mel Famey of the Milwaukee Braves was a natural .. A once-in-a-lifetime phenom whose fast ball blew away the best hitters. His 90 MPH curveball would start out like it was going to hit the batter's ear, only to break at the last instant and hit the outside corner of the plate for a strike. His changeup made the best hitters in the league cry .. They would swing, drop the bat, and stare incredulously as the ball hit the catcher's mitt. He was indeed awesome! Why then, you might ask, is he not in the Hall of Fame? Why haven't you ever heard of him? Alas, like many others before him, Mel's downfall was .. Alcohol. Ol' Mel really liked to tilt the glass. His drinking became almost legendary around the country, but he never let it affect his pitching until... This happened. The Braves and the Yankees in the World Series! Excitement reigned! The series was tied at three games apiece, and the Braves were in New York for the seventh and deciding game. The night before the big event, Mel's thirst got the better of him. He snuck out of the hotel after curfew, and bought himself two cases of beer. As you might imagine, the next morning Mel didn't feel too good. But being the pro that he was, Mel managed to do just fine .. Until the bottom of the ninth inning. With the Braves ahead by one run, two out and the bases loaded, Mel's revelry the night before finally caught up to him. Eight straight pitches .. Eight straight balls. He walked in the tieing and the winning runs, losing the game and the series. After the game, a reporter went to the jubilant Yankee's clubhouse and spoke to the last two players that faced Mel. \"Tell me,\" he asked, \"to what do you attribute this victory over the best pitcher in the major leagues?\" In unison they replied, \"It was the beer that made Mel Famey walk us!\"",

At a morning press conference, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said he believes the man is a member of the notorious Al-Gebra movement. He is being charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math instruction. \"Al-gebra is a fearsome cult,\" Gonzales said. They desire average solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in a search of absolute value. They use secret code names like 'x' and 'y' and refer to themselves as unknowns, but we have determined they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country. As the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, \"There are 3 sides to every triangle.\" When asked to comment on the arrest, President Bush said, \"If God had wanted us to have better weapons of math instruction, He would have given us more fingers and toes.\"",

The doctor listened to his bizarre farts, examined him thoroughly then proclaimed he was completely stumped. He sent the salesman to a Japanese doctor that specialized in rare diseases, but this doctor too didn't have a clue. He made an emergency appointment with a gastroenterologist. He too was baffled. On his way out of the last doctor's office, he was panicking. He had to cancel the meeting. How embarrassing would it be if in the middle of the chairman of Toyota's office he let a fart slip and it came out, \"hooonda!\" Just before he went out of the office door, the receptionist called after him. \"The doctor recommends you try going to a dentist.\" \"A dentist?\" He thought. What the heck. He was desperate at this point so he called a local dentist. When he arrived and described his problem to the old Japanese dentist, the dentist nodded his head and said, \"you have abscessed tooth.\" \"An abscessed tooth?!?\" The incredulous salesman says. \"Why the hell do you say that?\" To which the dentist replied, \"Everybody knows abscess make the fart go Honda,.\"",

The negotiations are going very well, but Mr. Oki can't seem to close the deal with the lawyer. The lawyer seems tired from his long trip and aggitated as a result. So - as is accustomed in Japan - mr. Oki arranges a special surprise for the lawyer: A gorgeous Japanese prositute to unwind the lawyer, will be waiting for him in his hotel room. The lawyer indeed finds a gorgeous woman waiting for him on his bed in his hotel room. Without any hesitation, he accepts this generous offer from the Japanese firm and begins to have wild, animal sex with the woman. While he's going down on her, she keeps screaming, \"Naki Naki!\" As he slowly penetrates her, she still screams, \"Naki Naki!\" 'Wow', he thinks to himself while doing his thing 'this girl's pussy is the tightest thing I've ever felt!'. And when he starts to really pound her, the screams get even louder: \"Naki Naki! NAKI NAKI!\" The lawyer concludes that this must be an expression of great joy in Japanese. Even as they're coming to an amazing climax, her last words are \"... Naki.. Naki...\" Before she falls asleep on the bed. The next day the lawyer meets up with mr. Oki on the golf course. The lawyer thanks mr. Oki for an amazing night, and mr. Oki is pleased to see him in such a good mood now. The lawyer - pretty full of himself after his spectacular performance last night - proceeds to hit a hole-in-one. Cocky and proud to show off his newly learned Japanese, he exclaims: \"Yeah! Naki naki!\" To which mr. Oki, puzzled, looks at the lawyer and says to him: 'What do you mean, \"wrong hole.\" ?'.",

Time passed and the boy became a teenager. Once again he watched his friends play sports, drive, and start to explore emotions of love and romance. Still the boy prayed every night for god to cure him, and still his prayers remained unanswered. Eventually the teen became a man. All his friends got married and started families. They no longer had any time to spend with him and the paraplegic man became very lonely. Despite this he still prayed every night to have the ability to lead a normal life. Finally one night, after a particularly emotional prayer, a bright light began to emanate from the sky. A heveanly choir began to sing as the clouds spread and the light shone right on the paraplegic man.

With her pulling and him pushing, the boots still didn't want to go on. When the second boot was on, she had worked up a sweat. She almost whimpered when the little boy said, \"Teacher, they're on the wrong feet.\" She looked and sure enough, they were. It wasn't any easier pulling the boots off then it was putting them on. She managed to keep her cool as together they worked to get the boots back on - this time on the right feet. He then announced, \"These aren't my boots.\" She bit her tongue rather than get right in his face and scream, \"Why didn't you say so?\" Like she wanted to. Once again she struggled to help him pull the ill-fitting boots off. He then said, \"They're my brother's boots. My Mom made me wear them.\" She didn't know if she should laugh or cry. She mustered up the grace to wrestle the boots on his feet again. She said, \"Now, where are your mittens?\" He said, \"I tuffed them in the toes of my boots...\"",

He orders a couple of beers, and after a few moments the bartender, head cocked, says, \"Buddy, I don't mean to be coarse, but what's with the octopus?\" \"This octopus?\" The guy begins, thumbing at his octopodine companion, \"Oh this guy is a musical virtuoso. He'd play any instrument you have here better than you've ever heard played before--\" The bartender cuts him off with a chortle. The guy doesn't miss a beat, \"And I'll bet you 50 bucks on an instrument of your choice.\" The bartender takes the bet and points to the piano. The octopus hops off the guy's shoulder, waltzes over to the piano, hops up and proceeds to tickle the ivories better than the bartender has ever heard before. He's flabbergasted. Incredulous. Stupefied. So he does what any man would do, and demands to go double or nothing. \"A lucky fluke, let's go one more time on this trumpet.\" The guy agrees without hesitation, the octopus plays the trumpet, and you know how well he plays it. Better than the bartender has ever heard before. Well, they keep going like this, double or nothing after double or nothing, instrument after instrument, until finally the bartender is into the guy for 3200 dollars. Looking desperate, the bartender says, \"Mac, this has got to end now. Let's go double or nothing just one more time and I either pay you three months of savings or we end up all clear.\" The guy mulls it over, thinking perhaps he should just walk with his guaranteed, substantial winnings. But being a gambler-at-heart and a businessman, he decides to go for it. \"Okay, one last double or nothing, and then we'll settle up.\" The bartender pulls out a set of bagpipes from behind the bar and hands them to the octopus. The octopus just starts fiddling with the pipes. After a minute of this, the guy says, \"Hey, Partner, we've got 6400 bucks on the line, are you gonna play that thing or what?\" The octopus looks at him, surprised, \"Play it?

Sitting in the mud, freezing, miserable, totally without hope, Juan looks up and says, \"God, why you do this to me, eh?\" Suddenly, the rain stops, the clouds disperse, the sun shines down, and Juan hears a deep, sonorous voice echo from on high... \"I don't know, Juan...

You need to get out and do something!\" \"Like what?\" The grandson inquired. \"When I was your age, some buddies of mine and I went to Paris for the most insane night of debauchery and fun we'd ever had! We got into the most expensive clubs, ran up a huge tab, and got out of paying for a dime of it! We waltzed into the priciest restaurants without reservations and talked our way into getting a free meal immediately. We went to the hottest strip clubs and got free lap dances, and I even had sex with a stripper onstage and nobody dared to fuck with me and my buddies! We were unstoppable!\" The grandfather smiled as he reminisced, remembering fondly his days in Paris. The younger man furrowed his brow and nodded. \"You know what grandpa? You're right. I do need to go out and do something with my life! I'm gonna grab my buddies and go to Paris, and do the exact same things you did!\" \"Atta boy,\" the elderly man responded. Two weeks later, the young man came home from Paris. However, when the expectant grandfather opened the door, he found his grandson in a sling, a neckbrace, and with two horribly black eyes. \"What the fuck happened to you?!\" Grandpa asked. \"I did all the same stuff you did!\" The man replied in dismay. \"We went to the best clubs, drank up a huge tab, but when we tried to leave without paying, the bouncer beat the shit out of me and broke my arm! We tried to push our way into a restaurant, but when we wouldn't leave the police were called and gave me these two black eyes with their night sticks! And worst of all, we went to a strip club, and when I tried to fuck a stripper onstage, I was nearly beaten to death by all the bouncers at once!\" \"Who the hell did you go with?\" Asked the grandpa incredulously. \"A group of my buddies.

He came to the first farm on his left, walked up the dirt driveway and greeted the farmer. He told him he wanted to buy a rabbit. The farmer looked at him and replied, \"Around here we don't call them rabbits, we call them Peter cotton tails,\" or you can just call them a, \"Peter,\" for short. He thanked him for letting him know and then said he wanted to buy a Peter if the farmer had one he could sell him. The farmer said he would be more than glad to sell him one, stuck a deal, and the city slicker continued down the gravel road on to another farm with his rabbit under one arm. The city slicker comes to the next farm, walks up the dirt driveway again, looks around for the farmer, then tells him he is looking to purchase a hen. The farmer replied, \"Around here we don't call them hens, we call them pullets.\" The city slicker thanked the farmer, then said he would like to purchase a pullet if he could from the farmer. The farmer said he has plenty to spare and would be glad to sell him one. They struck a deal and the city slicker was on his way again down the gravel road, now with one peter and one pullet under each arm. He reached the last farm on the end of the road, walked up to the farmer and told him he was interested in purchasing a mule, and asked if he had one he could sell. The farmer replied, \"Around here we don't call them mules, we call them Ass's.\" Again, the city slicker thanked the farmer and said he would like to purchase an Ass if he had one he could spare. The farmer said he had only one he could spare, and that is was a hard working Ass, but he did have a catch. The city slicker was a little concerned and asked what was wrong with the Ass. The farmer said the mule will be working and pulling nice and hard, and then suddenly stop dead in his tracks, BUT all you had to do was scratch him behind his ear, and he would go right back to work. The city slicker thought that was no real big deal and that he could easily handle that. So city slicker struck up a deal with the farmer and decided to head home with a cock under his right arm, a pullet under his left arm, and the Ass walking beside him. He was almost home when the Ass stopped dead in his tracks right in front of a lady working in her flower garden along the road. The city slicker looked a little distressed, so the lady asked if she could help him. He replied... \"Could you hold my peter and pullet while I scratch my Ass?\"",

At the front of the church they were met by a Vietnamese nun named Banh Hanh. \"She drinks, she smokes and she takes drugs!

She also talked about her personal life and how this was her last day as the church is transferring her to work in a cathedral in France. However, she said she'll stay if the church still needed her.

Well, let me assure you, that just isn't true. We'll use your skin to make our excellent canoes, your hair to make twine, and we'll eat every edible part of you. So really, it's not a waste at all.

What I will do for you is this: We just received 8 shiney brand new robot golf caddies. If you're willing to take one with you out on the course and come back and tell me how well it works, your round of golf is on me today.\" The golfer obviously accepted the man's offer. He approached the first tee, looked at the fairway and said to himself, \"I think my driver will do the job.\" The robot caddie turned to the man and said, \"No sir. Use your 3 wood. A driver is far too much club for this hole.\" Hesitantly, the golfer pulled out his 3 wood, made good contact with the ball, and the ball landed about 10 feet to the right front of the hole on the green. The golfer, delighted, turned to the robot and thanked him for his assistance. As the golfer pulled out his putter he said, \"I think this green is gonna break left to right.\" The robot then again spoke up and said, \"No sir. I do believe this green will break right to left.\" Thinking about the last time the robot corrected his prediction, he decided again to listen to the machine. He made his putt and birdied the hole thanks to the robot and his advice. But his luck didn't end there. His entire game was the best game he ever played, thanks to the assistance of the new robot golf caddie. Upon returning to the clubhouse, the man behind the counter asked, \"How was your game?\" The golfer stated, \"It was, by far, the BEST game I ever played. Thank you very much for letting me take one of your robots. See you next week.\" A week passed, and excited, the golfer returned to the pro shop. Upon entering, he turned to the man behind the counter and said, \"I would like 18 holes of golf and one of those robot golf caddies, please.\" The gentleman from behind the counter turned to the man and said, \"Well the 18 holes is no problem. However, we no longer have the robots. We had too many complaints.\" Confused, the golfer cried, \"COMPLAINTS? Who in the heck could've complained about those robots? They were incredible.\" The man sighed and said, \"Well, it wasn't their performance. It was that they were made of shiny silver metal, and the sun reflecting off them was blinding to other golfers on the fair way.\" The golfer said, \"So then why didn't you just paint them black?\" The man nodded sadly and replied, \"We did.

Happily, he began to play the course. An angel up above was watching the preacher and was quite perturbed. He went to God and said, \"Look at the preacher. He should be punished for what he is doing.\" God nodded in agreement. The preacher teed up on the first hole. He swung at the ball, and it sailed effortlessly through the air and landed right in the cup 250 yards away. A picture-perfect hole-in-one. He was amazed and excited. The angel was a little shocked. He turned to God andsaid, \"I beg your pardon, but I thought you were going to punish him.\" God smiled. \"Think about it-who can he tell?\"",

Her mum told her, \"Keep an apple in your vajazzle for a day, that'll make tight as knot!\" So the woman, having no other alternative, did as her mother told her. To the woman's surprise, it worked! Her husband couldn't hardly tell, so he was always complimenting her on her tight pussy. Due to its effectiveness, the woman continued to use an apple throughout her married life. One day when she removed the apple so she could take a bath, her husband stumbled upon the apple and ate it. The woman, not being particularly bright, figured she had to use the same apple for the whole day in order for it to work. Unsure what to do, she asked her mum for advice once again. To this, the mum replied, \"He'll be fine dear, your father ate the watermelon I was using and he was perfectly fine!\"",

He has brought ten apples with him, and the cannibal leader explains to him that he must fit all of the fruit in his butt without making any noise or they will kill him. The man tries but on the 4th apple he squeals and they kill him. Then the second man returns with blueberries. The cannibals tell him the same thing and he starts to put the blueberries in his butt. He gets to the 9th berry and bursts out laughing so they kill him. In heaven the first man asks the second man why he died if he only had blueberries to fit into his butt and the man respondes, \"I was almost there but I cracked up when I saw the last guy coming back with pineapples.\"",

Once he makes it past the sliding doors in his dashiki, he asks the receptionist, \"Which doctor gave me ebola?\" The woman's face pales, her hands begin to quiver, and she dials the phone rapidly. After a proper diagnosis is made by medical officials, he is rushed into a secure room in a secluded area of the hospital. Several doctors enter the room wearing hazmat suits. Once the doors are sealed shut, the man screams in a thick African accent, \"Which doctor gave me ebola!?\" The frightened and slightly confused doctors strap the man down to a hospital bed. The ebola patient jerks around in the bed screaming, \"Which doctor gave me ebola!?\" Shocked and mortified by the possibility of the virus spreading through the hospital staff, the hospital administrator orders the premises to be quarantined. Top-notch ebola experts are brought in to question the man. Determined to find the source of the illness, the African ebola patient is interrogated for several hours by the experts, but his response to every question is, \"Which doctor gave me ebola!?\" The man flails and kicks about in frustration and anger, and the medical staff become more impatient. After several days pass, the ebola experts finally lose their patience and give up. The man is left alone in the room in critical condition. Another day passes, and an African nurse walks in to check up on the man. The ebola patient is dying, and he can barely speak. He reaches out and grasps the nurse's hand with a soft touch. With his final breath, he whispers softly. \"Witchdoctor... Gave me... Ebola...\"",

He pulls off to the side of the road, about twenty feet away from the perimeter fence for a mental institution. There are a few patients milling about outside, but the fence is tall, and he's separated from it by a wide ditch, so the man pays them little attention, and goes about changing his tire. Having placed the lug nuts into the hubcap, the man proceeds to remove the tire. While doing so, he loses his balance, throwing a hand out to arrest his fall, which smacks the edge of the hubcap, sending his lug nuts flying down into the ditch. While standing there, trying to decide what to do, the man hears a voice from behind him. He turns to see that one of the patients has approached the fence and is addressing him. \"Excuse me,\" says the patient, \"But I noticed that you've lost your lug nuts. If you take one from each of your remaining wheels, You'll be able to put your spare on, and that should get you down the road to the next exit, where you can get some replacements.\" \"I hadn't thought of that, That's a great idea!\" Says the man, \"Say, why are you in that funny farm anyway?\" The paitent looks at him, and replies, \"I'm crazy, not stupid.\"",

Steve and his wife had sex every single night and had never been apart from one another since they tied the knot. One evening though Steve came home from work and said, \"Darling, I have some bad news. My company has ordered I go on a business trip for the next two months. I'm going to miss you dearly and I know you're going to miss me. Is there anything I can do for you before I leave?\" \"Well,\" says Steve's wife, \"you know how we have sex every single night?\" \"Yes I know dear.\" Said Steve. \"Well dear husband I want you to go out and buy me a dildo so I can have something to keep me company.\" Steve agrees and goes to the dildo shop. He looks around at all the dildos and sees big ones and small ones and ones with plugs and ones with sparkles. He approaches the shop keep and explains his predicament. \"Well that seems like a tall order,\" the shop keep says, \"two months is a long time for a woman to stay faithful and a hard job for one dildo to do. But I think I've got just the thing.\" The shop keep reaches under his counter and pulls out a box. Steve opens the box to find what appears to be just an ordinary dildo. \"Whats so special about this one?\" Asks Steve. \"Watch this!\" Replies the shop keep, \"I can command it. Voodoo Dildo! The door!\" And just then what seemed to be an ordinary dildo levitates from the box, travels to the door, and thunderously penetrates the keyhole. \"Remarkable!\" Says Steve. \"Now watch this!\" Says the shop keep, \"Voodoo Dildo! The pocket pussies!\" And the Voodoo Dildo switches from the keyhole to fucking the pocket pussies on display in the store. \"Sensational!\" Says Steve. Finally the shop keep stops the Voodoo Dildo by saying, \"Voodoo Dildo! Return!\" And the Voodoo Dildo levitated back to the box. Steve is very impressed by this magical sex toy and gladly purchases it from the store. Steve returns home with the box in hand eager to greet his wife and show off her new present. When he arrives he sees that she has gone to the grocery store. He leaves the package on their bed with instructions hes written on how to activate the Voodoo Dildo. Later in the evening Steve has gone to the airport and his wife has returned home. She spots the package left by her husband and without hesitation begins to open it. Inside she finds the Voodoo Dildo and Steves instructions. After reading the instructions she strips off all of her clothes and says, \"Well I guess we should see what this is all about. Voodoo dildo! My pussy!\" And the Voodoo Dildo begins to give her the best she's ever had. It starts slow but eventually makes her come again and again. After her fourth orgasm she thinks shes had enough but oh no! Steve forgot to include how to make the Voodoo Dildo stop! She tries pulling it and grabbing it but it wont stop. She calls 911 but the operator tells her not to make prank calls on the emergency hotline. She rushes to find anything she can to stop it but it just wont. She climaxes again and finally decides to put on her clothes and drive to the hospital. Once shes in her car she can barely drive. Shes rushing to the hospital but is swerving and turning due to her reoccuring orgasms. A police cruiser notices this and pulls her over. She reluctantly pulls to the side of the road as she climaxes again. The cop asks her to roll down her window and she explains the whole story to the cop. After her long explanation and hurried story the skeptical policeman rolls his eyes, looks at her, and says, \"Yeah right. Voodoo dildo my ass.\"",

The devil solves it and hands it right back to him. The mathematician says, \"Alright, I'll go to hell.\" And off he went. The devil then approaches the philosopher and says for him to give him any sophisticated philosophical idea, and he'll explain it. So the philosopher does this and gives it to the devil. The devil, again, explains it and the philosopher agrees to go to hell. Finally, the devil goes up to the idiot and says in an annoyed tone, \"Alright, wattaya got?\" The idiot thinks for a second and then declares, \"Get me a chair.\" The devil complies and gets the idiot a chair. \"Alright, now drill seven holes in it.\" Again the devil complies and drills seven holes. Then, the idiot sits down in the chair and he farts. \"Alright,\" the idiot declared with a grin. \"Which hole did my fart come out of?\" The devil was taken aback, and stood confused at the idiot. \"Uhh, that one!\" The devil said as he pointed to a random hole. \"No stupid.

Every time he was leaving for work in the field, his wife would make him very delicious sandwiches. The sandwiches were made out of fresh baked bread, with homemade butter, cheese, ham, and fresh vegetables: Tomatoes, lettuce and cucumbers. Eating them was his favorite part od the day, and he treated them as a reward for hard work he did. One day the peasant went to work in the field and left his sandwiches on a nearby rock as he always did. After a few hours of work, he took a break and headed to the rock to enjoy his lunch, but... It was gone! A little angry and confused, he went back to work. The next day began and it was passing by as usual. Until the lunch time, when the poor man came to the rock to find out his sandwiches disappeared again! He got angry, but there was not much he could do, so he returned to work. On the third day, the situation occured again. It was too much. This time the peasant got really pissed and decided that the next day he would hide behind a tree and wait to reveal the sandwiches thief. He did as he decided. He was waiting well hidden, keeping an eye on his lunch, but there was no living soul around. After an hour, suddenly, a great eagle flew out of nowhere, grabbed the lunch with it's claws and started to fly away. The shocked peasant threw himself into a pursuit of the bird. He followed the eagle until it landed in a nearby forest, not aware of being followed. The peasant hid behind a tree and watched the eagle. The bird unpacked the sandwiches and threw all of the ingredients out: Ham, cheese and fresh vegetables. Then the eagle took two slices of butter-covered bread, apllied them to it's chest rubbing them all over it, and said, \"oh my god, I am so fucked up.\"",

He finds a pet shop selling roosters and asks around for the youngest, most fit cock they have available to service his hens. In no time at all the salesrep directs him to a magnificent specimen, a real champ in the making, lean, strong, and quick as a switch to do his deed and be on to the next one. Thinking the asking price is fair for such a good rooster, the farmer buys him and when they get home he shoos the rooster toward the hen house and watches in amazement as the new cock takes straight to his task, servicing one, two, three, four hens in as many minutes. Within fifteen he's still going strong, and the farmer calls out, \"You better slow down there boy, you're going to die if you keep up that pace!\" The rooster keeps going with no mind to the farmer and the man decides to get on with the rest of his own duties for the day, assuming sooner or late the newcomer will tire out. To his amazement he finds the cock mounting the cows in the field some time later, and then the horses in the barn, and by mid afternoon the pigs in the sty! \"He's insatiable,\" the farmer says, wondering exactly how long this will go on. By nightfall the rooster's filled every animal on the farm and seems to show no sign of slowing down as the moon rises. The next day when the farmer awakens and goes to check on things, he finds the rooster laying dead in the middle of the yard with the telltale shadow of vultures circling about overhead. He can't help but admire the cock's tenacity and stamina and walks out to its corpse, squatting down to pat it on the back. \"I warned you,\" he says with a sigh. The rooster's head leans up and responds, \"Ssh, you'll scare away the vultures.\"",

This particular time she is really chewing him out saying she doesn't get laid enough and she has finally decided to divorce him and take half his things. The businessman pleads for his wife to stay, saying he will do anything for her. She asks him to make love to her right then and there but suddenly his phone rings. It's his boss and he tells the businessman to get to the airport in an hour for a very important deal which he cannot refuse. The wife loses her shit and the business man knows he can't stay but he tells her he will make it up to her somehow. He gets in the car and starts to drive to the airport. On the way he is freaking out knowing his wife is going to do something crazy while he's away. He stops at a red light and looks over to see a sex shop. A lightbulb goes off in his head and he parks and runs into the store. The little bell rings as he enters and he looks around. DVD's, whips, chains, lube, latex suits, mask, dildo. The man is completely overwhelmed so he rings the bell at the counter. A woman walks out from the back and the businessman asks for the most expensive item they carry in the store and that the price is of no concern. The lady take a box out from under the counter, it is covered in dust which she blows off and she opens it. Inside is a piece of wood, whittled into the crude shape of a cock. The businessman looks at the item, perplexed and confused and asks WTH is it suppose to be and how much does it cost. The lady says it is the legendary voodoo dick and it will cost him over 5000$. The businessman becomes outraged and asks why that pathetic looking wooden dildo is 5000$ and the dildo under the counter with a lube dispenser, rotating head and twelve speeds costs only 200$ the lady tells him the powers of the voodoo dick are not to be underestimated and gives him a demonstration. She leans in and tells the voodoo dick to fuck the female customer by the dvd rack. The voodoo dick starts to float out of the box the flies full speed across the store, up the womans dress and starts to fuck her silly, knocking DVD's all over the ground. She tells the voodoo dick to stop fucking the female customer and it flies back into the box and the lid magically closes. The business man slaps the money on the counter and buys it right away. He rushes home and gives his wife the gift and instructions then leaves for the airport, confident he just saved his marriage. For the first day the wife just looks at the box insulted her husband would get her a dildo. The second day she has some thoughts about using it but doesn't and on the third day she is watching Dr. Phil and decides 'fuckit' then brings the box into the bedroom and gets on the bed and takes the voodoo dick out of the box. She tells the voodoo dick to fuck her and it flies right into her pussy and gives her five orgasms in a minute. She can't take it anymore and tells the voodoo dick to stop but it continues its rampage inside her vagina. She freaks out and tries to put her clothes back on but she falls all over the place, when she finally manages to do that she goes into the garage and tries to get into her car. Fumbling and dropping her keys a few times she gets in and drives as fast as she can to the hospital. She is swerving and speeding until she sees the cherries of a cop car in her rearview mirror. She pulls over and this state trooper looking cop comes up to her window and taps on the glass with his flashlight. She rolls down her window and the cop asks her why she was speeding and tells her she could've killed someone, he demands to know an explanation for all of the reckless driving and she tells him about the voodoo dick. The cop looks at her with a stern expression, takes off his glasses, looks her right in the eyes and goes, \"Voodoo dick my ASS.\"",

Finally, he said to his pop, \"Dad, I want a green golf ball.\" The man was surprised a bit, but decided to humour his son. And so, the boy received 1 green golf ball for his 10th birthday.

Finally, he went up to his old man and said, \"Dad, I want 100 green golf balls.\" Now, the father was very curious about this, and asked his son, finally, why he wanted the balls. The boy just said, \"Dad! It's a secret!\" The father backed down, and got the boy his balls. When the boy graduated from college, his father once again offered him anything he wanted. Once again, the boy thought. Once again, the boy walked up to his father. He said, \"Dad, I want 1000 green golf balls.\" The father decided that the boy knew how to live his life. But still he asked, \"Why, son? Why do you want these green golf balls?\" And once again, the boy said, \"It's a secret, Dad!\" And then came the war. And the boy volunteered himself for his country. And when he came back in one piece, his father said, \"Son, I will get you anything that you want!\" And the boy thought. And thought.

Why do you need these green golf balls?\" And the son looked at thim, and he said, \"Dad, now, I told you that it was a secret. Please don't make me tell you.\" And the father backed off. The boy got married. His father walked up to him, and offered him anything he would want on this joyous occasion. The boy thought and thought and thought. And thought. And, finally, he said, \"Dad... I want 100,000 green golf balls...\" And the father, keeping calm, asked why. Why the boy wanted so many green golf balls.

I have dry mouth so bad now man! Sandpaper!\" So the monkey pointed to the left and said, \"go over that little hill and through the bushes. You'll find a nice cool stream to drink out of.\" So he made his way over the hill, and through the bushes down to the stream. He started drinking away with his eyes closed. After a satisfying drink, he opened his and eyes and WHOA! He was face to face with a big ass alligator. The alligator spoke before he could.. \"Salamander... Looks like you have been chiefin some fine ass weed! Where may I ask did you partake?\" \"Through those bushes and over the hill, there is a nice monkey in a tree.

Can we finally have sex?\" \"Of course!\" Replies the Mullah. \"AlIa ho Akber! Sex is OK within a marriage to have children!\" \"What about different positions?\" Asks the man. \"AlIa ho Akber! No problem,\" says the Mullah. \"Woman on top?\" The man asks. \"Sure,\" says the Mullah. \"AlIa ho Akber. Go for it!\" \"Doggy style?\" \"Sure! AlIa ho Akber!\" \"On the kitchen table?\" \"Yes, yes! AlIaho Akber!\" \"Can I do it with all my four wives together on rubber sheets with a bottle of hot oil, a couple of vibrators, leather harnesses, a bucket of honey and a porno video?\" \"You may, indeed.

To his horror he caught his son with his dick out jerking it like a madman. The farmer covered his face and walked away. His son came over a while later and the farmer said, \"Son, you really need to get laid. You're like 16. Here take our prize winning duck into town to see if you can trade a pretty lady for some sexing.\" The son agreed and took the duck into town. First, he asked some lady alongside the road if she would sex him up in exchange for his bird. She punched him in the mouth. This happened several times with bodily injury always being the result. Finally, the son staggered into a laudromat a few miles from home and saw a pretty lady doing some laundry. He asked, \"Excuse me miss, would be willing to have sex with me in exchange for this duck?\" The duck quacked. The woman was at first angry and about to punch him but realized that times were tough and that was one bitching looking bird. So she agreed and took him into the back room of the laundromat. The two of them proceeded to have sex and the now dazed son gave her the duck, per the prior agreement. When handed the duck, she hesitated and said, \"Hey, how about I trade you this duck back and we go have sex again?\" The son gasps and flails and takes his bird back and sprints with the woman to bump uglies for a second time. The woman is happy and sends the son home with her address and phone number. The dazed and foggy son takes his prized waterfowl directly out of the laundromat and is promptly run over by a truck. Luckily, he is ok but the duck is smashed and killed. The driver hops out and says, \"Gee, I sure am sorry. That seemed like a nice duck. Here is 50 cents to help you buy a new one.\" The boy happily accepts the money since it is a huge amount for that period and walks merrily home. Upon arriving the farmer sees his happy son in the setting dusk and asks him, \"Well son, how was your day?\" The son smiles enormously and says, \"Well dad, I gave a duck for a fuck.

On this planet there was a mountain, and atop the mountain was a tree which hosted the most delicious fruit known the the Trid race. But there was a problem: There was a cave near the top that was home to a monster, and every time the trids tried to climb to the top of the mountain, the monster would run out and kick them all back down. The trids became tired of this, and so they contacted Earth to ask for help. Earth didn't find this to be that big of a problem as they were at war and dealing with many different things, so they sent over a rabi. The Trids were happy to have any help they could get, and so they gladly accepted. The rabbi arrived and wanted to get straight to business, calling all of the Trids to the base of the mountain. A lot of them were too frightened, so only some showed up. The rabi led the Trids most of the way up the mountain, only to have the monster come out and kick all of the Trids down but not the rabbi. Frustrated, the rabbi went to the Trid village and told them that in order to get to the top, they would all have to show up and work together. The next day more Trids showed up, but not all of them were there. The rabbi sighed, leading them up to have the monster once again kick down all of the trids, but leave him standing. The rabbi went back to the Trid village and told them that if every single last Trid wasn't in attendence the following day, he would return to Earth without helping them. The next day, every single Trid was there. The rabbi smiled and started leading the Trids up the mountain, this time quite confident that they would make it all the way up. But as usual, the monster ran out of his cave and managed to kick every single Trid back down the mountain, once again leaving the rabbi standing. The rabbi went to the monster's cave and asked, \"Monster, why do you only ever kick down the trids, but always leave me standing?\" To which the monster replied, \"Silly rabbi, kicks are for Trids.\"",

And I DO like coffee...\" So, making up his mind, he tells the Devil, \"I'll take Hell Number Three!\" So the Devil stands to the side saying, \"As you wish,\" and Charlie wades in and takes his place, up to his knees in shit, and looks around for his coffee cup.

Satisfied by what he achieved, he showed his work to the chicken. \"That's amazing!\" Said the chicken, \"I bet I could put some vocals on that if I practiced!\" The chicken then took a year of its life to learn how to sing while the Horse played.

Drums!\" The pig then decided to take a year out of his life to learn how to play the drums with the other two. The three then proceeded to show the Sheep, who was amazed by this.

In this time they formed a band, and decided to tour the farm for 4 years, playing for a little extra money on the side, before the Horse got a call from a music agency. They finally got their big break to play at a famous music festival in America. The horse decided to make sure everything was going as planned, and flew over to America to set up stage and confirm their hotel reservations, playing time etc. After his hard few days, he sat in his Hotel room watching the news. On the news their was a report that an airplane had crashed into the Atlantic ocean. There were no survivors from the wreck. He suddenly realised that it was the plane that the Chicken, the Sheep and the Pig were on. Realising that he spent most of his horse life doing something that just went up in flames, he decided he needed a VERY stiff drink. He went down to the hotel bar, asking the bar man for the strongest drink he had. A few minutes later the barman came back and placed the drink on the countertop.

First, obtain a small wooden wedge with the thick end a couple of inches high, and with a shallow enough slope for a mouse to easily climb. Place it a couple of inches from a corner of the room, long end against one of the walls, high end facing the corner. Place a piece of cheese between the wedge and the corner. Erect a mouse-proof barrier, say a piece of glass, so as to force the mouse to go up the wedge to get to the cheese. It may take a day or two, but the mouse will eventually find and eat the cheese. This is now day one. Replace the cheese. The mouse will return that night and eat the new piece of cheese. Repeat until the mouse has eaten six pieces of cheese. This is now day seven. Do not replace the cheese. Instead, glue a fresh razor blade to the thick end of the wedge so the sharp edge sticks up three or four milimetres. Tonight, the mouse will run up the wedge, and move its head from side to side looking for the missing cheese.",
