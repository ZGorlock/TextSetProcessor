Hearing the Russians approach, the fugitives hide in two boxes and a sack. The KGB officer and his men enter the barn, and kick the first box. The fugative inside makes dog noises, so the officer moves on. He kicks the next box, and the man inside makes duck noises, fooling the officer again. The last fugutive has hidden in the sack. The officer kicks the sack, and the man inside, out of desperation, says, \"potatoes, potatoes.\" Immediately, the other two Latvians spring from their boxes, and rip the third to shreds, leaving nothing but blood and scraps of sack. The two men are returned to the gulag, along with the farmer whose barn the fugitives hid in, as he was, \"obviously,\" harboring the Latvians.",

Finally the old man found a plain old bag of goober nuts and he asked the clerk, \"ok how much are the goobernuts,\" the clerk said, \"they are 4.94.\" The old man shaking his head scooped himself a pound of goober nuts and took them up to the register, although the old man had done nothing but complain he said to the young clerk, \"I just want to thank you young man, I appreciate how kind you have been. I know that I have a very strange voice and often times people tend to mock me.\" The young clerk merely shook his head, \"no I want to thank you sir, most people tend to treat me different because of my long and Bulbous nose.\" The old man squinted looking at the young clerk.. \"You node that's your nose?, Fuck me I thought it was your dick your nuts were so freakin high.\" \"Much funnier when you do the old mans voice in all reality.\"",

You are gonna need a good gun though because he is massive.\" \"Ok, give me that 30-06. That should do it.\" John buys the gun and leaves the store and the next day heads out to the ridge and scans the valley below. At 2pm a huge bear wanders into his binoculars. \"There he is! I'm gonna get him!\" John sets down the binos and picks up his rifle. He looks through the scope into the valley but doesn't see the bear. \"Hmm. That's strange.\" Just then he feels a tap on his shoulder. He lowers the rifle and looks behind him. He gasps in fear as he sees the bear standing over him. \"What do we have here?\" Says the bear. \"Looks like a free lunch.\" \"Oh please don't eat me says John. I will do anything.\" \"Well...\" The bear says, \"There is one thing. You have to let me fuck you in the ass. Then I will let you go.\" \"Um... Ok. Just don't eat me.\" Says John. The bear fucks him and lets him leave. John is so angry that the next day he goes back to the gun shop and tells them he needs a bigger gun and that he is going to get that damn bear. \"Give me that 7mm rifle!\" John buys the rifle and the next day goes to the ridge. Scanning with the binos he sees the bear again! \"Got you now!\" He whispers to himself. He shoulders the rifle, looks the scope, and the bear is gone again. \"What the hell?\" He thinks. Just then a tap on his shoulder startled him. He turns around in shock to see the bear there standing over him again. \"Back again I see.\" Says the bear. \"What will it be this time? Do I eat you or fuck you?\" \"Fuck me,\" John grumbles under his breathe. So the bear fucks him again and lets him go. The next day he is so furious that he returns to the gun shop again. \"I want the biggest weapon you have here!\" John screams at the salesman. \"I'm gonna get that fucking bear!\" \"Ok, well, its not really legal but we have this RPG in the back. Be careful though because we only have one rocket,\" says the clerk. The next day, John returns to the ridge determined to kill the bear. He looks through the binos for the bear, locating him near some trees. \"This time you are mine!\" John whispers to himself. He grabs the RPG, aims into the valley, but no bear. Again he feels a tap on his shoulder. Hanging his head, John turns around to see the bear there again smiling at him. The bear says, \"You ain't here for the hunting are you boy...\"",

He boarded the bus and found a seat next to a group of boys, whom he heard talking fast and excitingly. Jimmy couldn't make out much of what they were saying, but he did hear the phrase, \"purple wombat,\" repeated multiple times. \"But what is the purple wombat?\" Jimmy asked. One of the boys turned to him, \"You don't know what the purple wombat is?\" Jimmy was about to answer, \"no,\" but it was time to leave the bus and go to his first class. In this class he again heard some kids talking about the purple wombat and again asked them what it meant. \"Jimmy, would you please come up here for a second.\" The teacher said. Jimmy went up. \"Don't you know not to talk in class?\" The teacher asked. \"Yes,\" said Jimmy, \"but I was just asking about the purple wombat.\" With that the teacher scolded him and sent him to the principal's office. In there the principal asked him what was the cause of him being sent there. \"I just asked about the purple wombat!\" Jimmy exclaimed. \"That's it young man, you're going home right now!\" Yelled the principal. At home his mother was furious and demanded to know the reasons for Jimmy being sent home. \"All I did was ask about the purple wombat.\" Jimmy sobbed. \"Go to your room right now!\" Ordered his mother. Jimmy went to his room and stayed there for the rest of the day. At around midnight he heard a strange sound coming from outside his window. It was a voice. Jimmy opened his window to hear it better. \"Jiiimmmmmmmyyyy, I am the purple wombat, come to the island on the lake tomorow night.\" Said the strange yet soothing voice. Jimmy was so excited, he would finally know what all the fuss was about. The next night, Jimmy got his canoe out of the shed and brought it down to the lake next to his house. He rowed out on the water and headed toward the small island. When he was close enough, he saw the purple wombat on the shore. Overcome with excitement, Jimmy stood up, but accidentally shook the canoe and fell overboard. Moral of the story: Don't stand up in canoes.",

As the food is finished, the boyfriend notices that it's about to rain and goes and grabs the vasoline and the tarp from his bag. The father says, \"Ok, I'll do the dishes.\"",

            "joke": "That's some pig: A salesman for Case New Holland is making the rounds one day when he drops in on a farm he's never been to before. As he pulls into the farmyard, a large pig in the pen by the barn catches his eye. He wanders over for a closer look and to his astonishment he sees that the pig has a wooden leg! As he is staring at the pig, the farmer emerges from the barn and extends a greeting. The young salesman introduces himself, but then curiosity gets a hold of him and he asks the farmer about the pig with the wooden leg. The farmer replies, \"Well young man, that is no ordinary pig. That's a special pig.\" \"I can see that,\" said the young salesman, \"but why does he have a wooden leg?\" \"Well let me tell you.\" Said the farmer. \"One day I was plowing right there on the other side of that pig's pen when I stopped the tractor to move a big rock out of the way. Don't you know that tractor slipped into gear and would have run me over 'cept that pig broke through the fence and pushed me out of the way just in time.\" \"So is that how the pig lost his leg?\" \"No, no, no,\" said the farmer, \"I'm trying to tell you that is one special pig. Why just a couple of months ago the wife and I were sound asleep about three in the morning when a fire broke out on the porch over there. That pig broke through the pen, rushed to the house and made such a ruckus we were woken up in time to put out the fire. He saved our lives!\" \"So did he lose his leg in the fire?\" Asked the young man. \"No, no, no,\" said the farmer. \"I'm trying to tell you. That's one special pig! Why just four weeks ago I was home alone. I had a heart attack. That pig ran into the road and right in front of the first car that came by. When the driver got out the pig led the man to me lying in the barnyard. The driver called an ambulance. That pig saved my life!\" Alight, alright, I get it. That's one special pig, but why does he have a wooden leg?\"\" Mister, \"the farmer said,\" a pig like that you don't eat all at once. \"",

Where is he?!\" \"Who?\" The wife says The husband starts looking around his apartment for the man, and finds a guy hiding on the window, so he goes to grab a baseball bat, signed by Bryce Harper, and starts trying to hit the man on the window, while evading the hits from the husband, the man fell off the window, of course, the husband begins to celebrate, until he realizes he fell on a truck full of pillows! \"So, St. Peter, since I couldn't let him get away with it, I fucking threw my fridge at him!

Cause when he saw me he grabbed a baseball bat, signed by Bryce Harper, which I thought was funny, and he tried to hit me!\" \"Oh god I can see where this is going.\" St. Peter thinks holding in laughter, \"Now, I've never been very agile myself, so while dodging, I fell! While I was falling I muttered a quick prayer and to my surprise, I was spared! I had fallen on a truck with pillows! My happiness was such that I forgave my agressor, until I looked up and saw him and a fridge coming down on me, and here I am.\" \"Well, sir, you've been a good man, what happened was an accident but we can't do anything, but heaven is open for you,\" says St. Peter Man 3 comes in, rather startled, \"Well what did you do?

A few weeks go by, and the man only wabts to put his penis in the pickle slicer more and more, so he goes to his manager, to ask for help, and the manager refers him to an occupational therapist and gives him some time off.

As ordered, Russians begin to skin him and move on to the next prisoner. Next was the German. He produces a pistol from his belt and, full of pomp and circumstance, goosesteps behind the tree line. The Ruskis wait for the gunshot and are rewarded. But when they check behind the tree line to retrieve the body, they find none. They shrug, thinking that there's no way he could possibly have run off to some place warmer. But with one less skin and winter approaching, they move on to next prisoner. Last is the Japanese. Stoic to the end, he gets on his knees and draws his sword. Plunging it into his gut and twisting it every which way, he never even flinches. Rather, he looks the Red Army officer straight in the eye and says, \"fuck your coat.\"",

After sitting and watching and listening for a while a kestrel flew near me and kept circling around doing acrobatic manoeuvres. After a few minutes I realised that I had this strange feeling that I hadn't had before. I looked down and saw that I had an erection.

A high school couple near graduation after which they will be going to separate colleges. As one last date they go to the local pier and exchange rings with each other. They both vow as long as they're in college they won't contact each other but will wear the rings as long as their love stays. They agree if they each still love each other after four years upon finishing college, they'll meet back at the pier and get engaged. Four years pass and neither the boy or girl takes off the ring or loses any love for the other. Upon the day of their planned reunion, the boy realizes a time was never set for meeting with his girlfriend again at the pier, so he heads out at sunrise with a fishing pole to kill some time and wait for his love. The girl heads out at sunrise too, but unfortunately mistakes which pier the arranged meeting was supposed to take place at, causing her to go to the incorrect one. She waits at the pier all day and upon her boyfriend failing to show up angrily tears the ring off of her finger and throws it into the ocean where it is swept away in the surf. The boy waits at the pier all day passing the time by fishing and enjoying the weather while he waits for his girl. The bites had been slow up until that point and he fell into a daze when suddenly he feels a tug at the end of his line. He excitedly reels in the line as fast as he can but is quite perplexed when on the other end of the line is not a fish but a very wet rice cake.",

After paying $500,000, he takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light. While waiting for the light to change, an frail looking old man on a yellow moped pulls up next to him. The old man looks over at the Ferrari and asks, \"What kind of car ya' got there, Sonny?\" The young man replies, \"A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!\" \"Wheeewee... That's a lot of money,\" says the old man as he tucks his thumbs up against his suspenders. \"Why does it cost so much?\" \"Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!\" States the banker proudly. The moped driver asks, \"Mind if I take a look inside?\" \"No problem,\" replies the proud new owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around at all the bells and whistles lining the dashboard. Sitting back on his moped, the old man whistles and says, \"That's a pretty nice car, all right... But I'll stick with my moped!\" Just then the light changes, so the banker decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph! Suddenly, he notices a yellow dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be, and suddenly... Whoooooosssshhhhh! Something blows by him, going much faster! \"What in the hell could be going faster than my Ferrari?\" The young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 250 mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 275 mph. Whoooooosssshhhhh! He's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again! Dumbfounded, the banker floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again! The Ferrari red lines and there's nothing more he can do! Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end. The young man stops and jumps out, and unbelievably, the old man is still alive. He runs up to the mangled old man and says, \"Oh my God! Is there anything I can do for you?\" The old man whispers with his dying breath... \"Unhook... My... Suspenders... From... Your...

He buys a suitable young'un from the rooster emporium and turns him loose in the barnyard. The old rooster sees it strutting around and gets a little worried. \"So they're tryna replace me, eh?\" The old rooster thinks. \"I'll show them!\" It walks up to the new bird and says, \"so you think you're the new stud in town? I bet you really think you're hot stuff don't you? Well, I'm not ready for the chopping block yet. I'll bet I'm still the better bird, and to prove it, I challenge you to race around that hen house over there. We'll run around it ten times and whoever finishes first gets to have all the hens for himself.\" Confident in his ability to outpace the old cock, the young roosters remarks, \"Hah! You're on, and since I'm so great you can even have a half a lap headstart and I'll still win easy!\" So the two roosters head over to the hen house to start the race with all the hens gathering to watch. The race begins and all the hens start cheering the old rooster on. After the first lap, he's still maintaining his lead. However, with each lap the old rooster lets it slip a little as the new guy catches up. It's the seventh lap and each rooster is frantically sprinting, with the old rooster just barely leading. By now, the farmer has heard all the commotion. He grabs his gun and runs into the barnyard, figuring a fox or something is after his chickens. When he gets there, he sees the two roosters running around the hen house with the old one still lightly in the lead as they near the last lap. The farmer takes aim with his shotgun and blows the young rooster to smithereens. Walking away in bewilderment, he mutters to himself, \"damn, that's the third, gay rooster I've bought this month!\"",

He looks around and sees lots of dildos, sex dolls, vibrators and etc, but nothing that would keep his wife occupied for 3 weeks. So he asks the clerk, who happens to be the store owner, and though at first the clerk says there is nothing there that would keep a person satisfied for that long, after some badgering, he finally pulls a black ebony box with a gold clasp from underneath the counter -- all the while assuring the newlywed that it's not for sale, being a family heirloom and of priceless sentimental value. He opens the box, and inside is an apparently normal dildo. The newlywed guy is unimpressed, but the clerk interrupts. \"Let me demonstrate,\" he says. He looks at the box and says, \"Voodoo Dick -- The Door!\" And the voodoo dick jumps into the air, floats over to the door, and starts going at the keyhole like crazy, pounding away until the door begins to crack down the center. Finally, the clerk says, \"Voodoo Dick -- The Box!\" And the voodoo dick flies back into the box. With some difficulty, the guy convinces the clerk to sell it to him. When he arrives home, he gives his wife the box and says, \"Just open it and say, 'voodoo dick, my pussy' if you ever get horny, all right?\" So he leaves on his business trip, and by the third day, the wife is getting pretty horny. So she opens the box and says, \"Voodoo dick, my pussy,\" thinking the whole thing rather rediculous. After about 15 minutes, she has had several orgasms and is starting to get tired, so she tries to pull the voodoo dick out. Apparently, her husband had forgotten to tell her how to turn it off. So she puts on a dress and starts driving to the hospital. About half way there, the voodoo dick is pumping away at her, and she starts multiple orgasming, and so she swerves a bit over the yellow line. A police officer happens to be behind her, and pulls her over. As the cop stands at the window, she is sweating and her face is blushed, and she's squirming all over as the voodoo dick goes at her. The cop looks at her for a second and says, \"Lady, how many drinks have you had tonight?\" She says quickly, \"Officer, I swear I haven't had anything to drink! There's this voodoo dick going at my pussy and I can't make it stop! I'm on the way to the hospital to have it removed!\" The officer thinks about it for a second, gives her a smirk and says, \"Voodoo Dick my ass, lady.\"",

Instead of chicken and fries, it was big ass fruits! It was too much and after two weeks, John saw God passing by. He said: Hey God! God! Can I ask you something?

Life goes on as normal for a while, he climbs trees, breaks cocunuts and swims in the sea. Then a few weeks later the man gets the horn again. He looks at the dog, \"nah I don't fancy the dog,\" he says. He looks at the pig and, \"Yeah, I fancy the pig, I could do the pig!\" He tries again to fuck the pig. But again the dog jumps to the pigs defense, snarling and biting, not letting the man near the pig. \"Fuck it, bloody dog,\" says the man and retires to his shelter, his lust defeated.

The man looks at the dog, \"Nah I don't fancy the dog,\" he says. He looks at the pig, \"yes I fancy the pig, I could do the pig,\" he says, and once again he tries to fuck the pig. However again the dog jumps to the defense of the pig, gnashing and snarling and the man is beaten and returns to his shelter his lust defeated. A few days later he's walking along the beach when to his surprise he discovers the body of a young woman. He pulls her out of the sea and carries her to his shelter. She's unconscious at first but he feeds her and gives her water and after a week she is nursed back to health. \"You know you really helped me,\" says the woman. \"Really?\" Said the man. \"Yes, without you I would have died on that beach,\" she said. \"So infact I owe you my life.\" Then... Suggestively touching her swimsuit she says, \"You've been stuck on this island a time right? It must get lonely here? Is there any thing I can do for you?\" \"Well,\" says the man after some consideration. \"There is one thing... Can you take the dog for a walk!\"",

Then a third time the cowboy bought again and the Mexican grinned and spoke something but the bar-tender never knew what he said. Then the cowboy seemed to be infuriated and stood up suddenly grawing his gun and shot the Mexican dead... At the cowboy's hearing the judge the judge asked the cowboy, \"Why did you suddenly become enraged for no apparent reason and shoot this individual dead.\" \"Well, the cowboy explained, I tried to be friendly and he began calling me names and insulting me for no reason and finally I got mad.\" \"What names did he call you that made you so mad that you wanted to kill him?\" Asked the Judge. \"Well, answered the cowboy, three times I bought him a drink, and each time he grinned in my face and called me Grassy Ass...\"",

The old men who tire very easily from walking too long, are told their deposit is non-refundable but will receive $150 off their $1,000 accommodation, due to the lifts being out of service and so they grab their keys and muble their disgust at the receptionist.

Ron was not the easiest guy to talk to, but I was curious as to why he would be fishing alone on his honeymoon. So I said, \"Hi Ron. Surprised to see you out here today.

Sometimes he changes it like for the New Years he sets it as the year, or Christmas time when he changes it to the date, but it's late fall right now so there he has it set as the regular code. Although once he decided to be a little generous, he got a new heating system for the office, it's a little screwy sometimes, you turn the heat on but it never actually turns on. But the heaters came with new thermostats, these show the date and the time on them. There are only three other guys in the office, Tim, he's just a weird one, he asks about what kind of stamps we buy, I don't like him much. Then there is some gay guy. I can't remember his name, he's not exactly a vibrant person, he blends in to the office like he is part of it. Lastly there is an old guy, he's been in the office for decades now, I think he might just be dead and no one ever checked, I have never seen that man leave his office chair. Right now, we are all working overtime, I think I might have forgotten to go home last night, I can't remember. There was a big crisis back at HQ and now we are stuck with the paperwork. I really don't know what day it is. Suddenly that old guy yells over, \"Turn up the heat!\" I don't blame him, it's freezing, must be that new heating. After he sees me get up he decides to go be unproductive somewhere else by taunting the other guys. I walk over to the thermostat, I figure I should see what time it is, since I don't remember sleeping. It's nine o'clock on a Saturday. The regular code, I punch it right in.

Here's what you need to do: First, hire a bunch of others to do your fishing for you. You and your wife get cooking all day, everyday. Make a name for yourself and hire more people to sell your product to all the restaurants in the area until you're a local name. Then open your own place, work hard day and night and make it a success then open another and another, delegating and training more people to take over sections of the business. Grow and expand into other towns, invest in advertising, eventually open up a franchise and go international! At the height of your business, sell it! You'll make a fortune.\" The local waits for the translation, thinks carefully, then asks, \"and what would I do with this fortune?\" The businessman laughs and replies, \"Whatever you want! You could go fishing everyday, spend all the time with your family, cooking with your wife, playing with your kids...\"",

Then, your typical 2-way street walks in, sees the little alleyway in the only chair and politely asks him to move. \"Mr. Alley, you seem to be in my seat, could you please find somewhere else to drink your beverage?\" The little alley squeaks, \"Oh I'm so sorry Mr. Two-way street, I didn't ummm realize I was in your chair. Here you go.\" The little alley downs his water and scampers out of the bar. The two-way street orders some Pepsi and sits down to read his morning paper. Suddenly, a mean old 2-lane highway storms in, and yells, \"Out of my seat ya weenie.\" The street replied, \"Sir, I'm trying to enjoy my refreshment and read the morni...\" WHAM! The highway smacks the street on the head and the street decides he's going to be a pacifist today, \"I mean of course, it's your seat, my apologies.\" \"Gimme some beer, not that pussy ass girly cola.\" The bartender pulls out the finest Miller Light he can find and passes it to the highway. All was peaceful until around 4PM when Interstate 95 runs in during rush hour, \"MOVE OUT OF THE WAY BITCH I'M IN A HURRY.\" \"FUGGIN MAKE EM YA BASTARD,\" and the two hammer away at each other. The two go at it for a few minutes, but the highway could not keep up with the fury of hundreds of short-tempered drivers that had just been cut off. The interstate grabs the highway, \"GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY ASS,\" and tosses him where the 2-way street was nursing his headwound. The interstate claims victory, finishes his beer and says, \"QUICK BARTENDER, GIMME SOME VODKA.\" The interstate begins to down vodka by the handle. Halfway through the 3rd handle of vodka, the Autobahn walks in, \"Out of my way, you puny little piece of asphalt.\" The Autobahn grabs his gun and puts 6 rounds into the interstate. He sits down and tells the bartender, \"I want the blood of my enemies mixed with your hardest rum on the rocks, shaken, not stirred.\" The bartender squeezes out some of the interstate's blood from an open gunshot wound and uses the bullets for ice. He mixes it with rum and serves it to the autobahn. But before the autobahn can pick up his drink, a little dirt bike trail walks in. The autobahn says, \"Ha, I suppose you're gonna make me move out of my chair?\" The trail starts screaming and grabs the autobahn by his head and rips him limb from limb. With a guttural cry of victory the little bike trail runs out. At this point, the highway has recovered sufficiently to ask the street, \"Gee what's his problem?\" The street replies, \"Oh him? He's a cycle path.\"",

A mentally retarded kid decides that he wants to join the war effort too so he heads down to the Marines recruiting station. They just laugh at him and tell him to go try one of the other branches. He heads over to the air force, they tell him it's not going to happen but maybe he'll have better luck with the navy. He tries them and gets told that they are desperate but not THAT desperate, he should go try his luck with the Army. So he heads over to the army recruiters and sure enough, they sign him right up. The kid starts his training and when the time comes to be assigned their riffles he is the last one in line. By time he gets to the front they are all out of guns. The guy handing out the guns hands the kid a broom instead. The retarded kid asks him what he is suppose to do with a broom and the army guy tells him, \"Well son, this is a magic broom. When you see the Germans comin, just point your broom at them and say 'banga banga banga' and they'll all fall over dead.\" So the kid takes his broom and leaves. The next day they are handing out bayonet's and again, the kid is the last one in line. When he gets to the front they give him a piece of string. Again the kid asks what he is suppose to do with a piece of string. The army guy ties it to his broom and tells him. \"Well, if the Germans get too close, just move your broom back and forth and say 'slishidy slash, slishidy slash' and they'll fall over dead. Time passes and the kid finally finds himself on the front line facing the German army. He points his broom at them and starts saying 'banga banga banga' and sure enough, the Germans start falling over dead. A little while later and the Germans are still advancing, now they are right on top of the American forces. The kid starts swinging his broom from side to side saying 'slishidy slash, slishidy slash' and again the Germans start falling over dead. A little more time passes and the kid sees the biggest German he has ever seen coming over the hill. He points his broom at him and says 'banga banga banga' but nothing happens, the German keeps coming right at him. The kid starts swinging his broom back and forth and saying 'slishidy slash, slishidy slash' but again nothing happens. The German keeps coming, runs right into the kid, knocks him over. As the kid is being smashed into the mud he looks up and the last thing he hears is the German saying.\" Tankady tankady tankady\".",

But as the week rolls on, the dares slowly get worse as each of the cowboys try to win the battle. As they entered town, one stinking of manure and looking to one up his friend, they decide to go to the saloon for a drink. And he sees it, a dirty old spittoon sitting under the bar, glistening in the evening light. \"Hey Kevin,\" he proclaims, \"I dare you to drink the contents of that spittoon there.\" Kevin, not looking to be called a wuss quickly accepts and struts over to the spittoon. He grabs it and has to peel if off the floor, leaving a spot that hasn't seen sunlight for years. He takes a quick whiff to see what he's getting into and dry heaves. But he quickly pulls himself together, cleans some dried spit off the rim with his sleeve, puts his lips to the rim and tilts his head back. At this point the smell hits the whole saloon, just straight purification, clearing most of the clientele out, covering their mouths and seeking fresh air. Joe begins gulping down the contents, heaving and convulsing after every swallow, letting excess run down his chin and chest. Down his front is just this rotten, pussy, brown and black swirled slime, with chunks of chew and butts falling and splatting on the floor. After a minute of this his friend eyes watering and mouth dropped open comes to with a fresh whiff of rancid eggs. He heaves and cries, \"Kevin, stop, that's enough, you win! I can't stand it anymore, you have to stop.\" At this point, Kevin tips his head back farther and starts drinking more, letting more pussy sludge run around the edge of the spittoon. His friend seeing this looses it and runs outside to vomit. Five minutes later Kevin comes outside, green in face, empty spittoon in hand, and completely soiled with rotten mucus and spittle. Everyone in town is crowded around the entrance to the saloon curious about what was happening, covering their mouths trying to protect themselves from the disease the man is radiating. His friend slowly stands up, cleaning the vomit from his mouth and asks, \"Why didn't you stop? I said you won.\" Kevin looks his friend square in the eyes and flatly responds, \"It was all one piece.\"",

You know, multi-colored hair, tats and piercings, and dresses like it's constantly at a rave. The only thing in the world a Trid gives a damn about is having fun. That's it. If it's not fun, a Trid simply isn't interested. Well, one day a Trid happens to be walking through the forest, trying to figure out something fun to do. He was bored, and boredom is worse than hard labor to a Trid. As he's walking along, he spots a rabbit a little ways ahead of him. \"Hmm, it might be fun to chase that rabbit.\" The little Trid thought to himself, so he took off running towards the rabbit. The rabbit takes one look at the Trid running towards him, and bolts away at top speed. The Trid starts laughing and pours on the speed, trying as hard as he can to catch up to the rabbit. \"Oh, what fun!\" The little Trid exclaimed, as he dashed after the rabbit around trees, and over rocks. Suddenly the rabbit hooked a mad turn and started up a tall hill, running like the wind. At the top of this hill, a goblin happened to be dozing in the warm sunshine. The rabbit was moving so fast, he ran over the goblin without even seeing him. Waking up startled, the goblin looks down the hill to see the Trid coming at him at full steam. So, he waits until the Trid reaches the top of the hill... And he kicks him! Down the hill the Trid went rolling and bouncing, head over heels, to land in a heap at the bottom. Picking himself up, he squeals with delight. Being kicked down the hill was the most fun he had ever had, and he went running back up the hill, where the goblin once again kicked him back down. Over a dozen times the Trid ran up the hill, and over a dozen times he was kicked back down, each time being more fun than the last. He was getting ready to run up again, when a sudden thought occurred to him; This would be even more fun with more Trids! So he high-tailed it back to Trid village to let everyone know about the hill and the goblin. Soon, there were dozens of Trids at the hill. They would run up one side of the hill, and the goblin would kick them down the other side. Meanwhile, the rabbit that the first Trid had been chasing was wondering what had happened to his playmate. He had been enjoying the chase as much as the Trid had, and he went to see what had happened. He came back to the hill and saw the line of Trids and the goblin kicking them. Shrugging he shoulders, he got in line and followed the Trids up the side of the hill. When he got to the top however, the goblin just stood there staring at him. \"What's wrong?\" The rabbit asked, \"Why won't you kick me down the hill?\" The goblin shook his head and said, \"Silly rabbit, kicks are for Trids!\"",

He manages two, three times, but during the fourth one, he gives up. Next comes the Frenchman. He gets up to seven, then during the eighth one, he gives up. Finally comes the Hungarian. The girl is drawing little lines on a paper to help her count. It goes up to eight and the Hungarian still doesn't show signs of tiredeness. So she decides to only count every third one from now on. But still, even when she's only counting every third one, the Hungarian manages eleven, twelve. She gets scared now, so she decides to only count every fifth one from now on. But even when she's only counting every fifth one, the Hungarian manages fourteen, fifteen. The girl is really alarmed at this point. Suddenly, the Hungarian looks at the paper and exclaims: \"Hey, you're cheating! We're starting over!\"",

He stops to watch the throngs of people giving money to the beggar who holds the Cross while none give to the beggar holding the Star of David. Finally, the Pope approaches the beggar with the Star of David and says, \"My poor fellow, don't you understand? This is a Catholic country; This city is the seat of Catholicism. People aren't going to give you money if you sit there with a Star of David in front of you, especially when you're sitting beside a beggar who is holding a Cross. In fact, they would probably give more money to him just out of spite.\" The beggar with the Star of David listened to the Pope, smiled, and turned to the beggar with the Cross and said, \"Jignessbhai, look who's trying to teach the Patel brothers about bijness!\"",

He didn't really feel like shopping anymore, so he put his jeans back on and walked out in his sock feet. He informed mall security and they escorted him to the control booth so he would look at the surveillance cameras to try to spot the guilty canine. The mall security looked and looked at footage while Roy had some coffee someone had offered him out of pity. Well, finally, the security guard thought he saw the culprit on screen in another part of the mall. He motioned to the hapless victim and lamely said, \"Pardon me, Roy, is that the dog that ate your new shoes?\"",

He will say no, and each time he does, you will instantly grow 3 inches.\" The girl, skeptical but still more desperate, seeked the midget the next day. Indeed there he was, short, stout and with a mean grimace smeared like peanut butter from jaw to jaw, and once the girl asked for his hand in marriage he yelped a defiant, \"No!\" And marched off in a huff. And wouldn't you know it, the girl had, indeed, grown three inches. Ecstatic from the results, she revisited the midget the next day, and the next, each time boldly rejected with a simply, \"No!\" But growing another six inches for her trouble. Now standing at a proud 5 foot 9, the girl pondered whether she should make one last visit. Her height was now certainly more than adequate, but what she truly longed was to have a grand physique, to be statuesque. So the girl, in high spirits, made one last trek across town to the grouchy midget. \"Kind sir, would you please accept my proposal of marriage?\" To which the midget, flush red in the face, exclaimed: \"No, you stupid cunt, no!

Now, as she's lying there not wanting to crawl from under the covers, he gets ready and rushes out of the house. She starts to wonder, \"do I really have a big vagina? I've always assumed it was normal sized.\" She then decides to try to not dwell on it and goes to wake up the children. One by one the kids are awake and dressed, and she prepares their lunches for them, hurrying them off to the bus stop. She goes back into the house to get ready and run and pay bills and other errands. Most st of the day she has been trying to ignore the statement her husband had made, but over the course of the day it starts gnawing at her. She decides that she will investigate this matter when she gets home. The woman makes a stop by a store and pics up one of those long rectangular wall hanging mirrors. Not realizing the time of the day and noticing it's close to the time the youngest child's bus arrives at home she speeds home and frantically runs upstairs with the mirror. She strips naked and is standing over the mirror lying on the floor. Closely examining her body. In all of her anxiousness she doesn't hear the front door open and the footsteps on the staircase, and all of the sudden she hears a small voice cry out, \"whoa mom!

He says they are a fair tribe and other him a chance of freedom if he completes 3 tasks. The pilot, ecstatic about possibly living agrees without hesitation. He is taken to a clearing with 3 identical huts. The chief says, \"In the first hut is 6 bottles of the finest Russian vodka, drink them all in an hour. After that, in the second hut, there is a lion that has not eaten for days because he has a bad toothache. You need to remove the tooth using only your hands and you only have an hour. In the last hut there is a woman from the village who has never been satisfied sexually. You have only an hour to satisfy her.\" The pilot, just thinking about survival rushes into the first hut. To everyone's amazement an empty bottle of vodka is tossed out every 10 minutes. An hour goes by and the pilot stumbles out of the hut completely drunk. After a couple of tries he eventually makes it into the second hut. Almost instantly the lion starts roaring and the pilot starts screaming. This goes on for about a half hour then it goes silent. A few minutes later the pilot stumbles out, claw marks all overn and clothes just covered in blood. He stumbles up to the chief, reeking of booze, leans in and asks, \"So, where is the lady with the toothache?\"",

The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, RayBan sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, \"If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?\" Bud looks at the man, who obviously is a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, \"Sure, why not?\" The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Macbook Air, tethers it to his Galaxy S3 and uses its built-in GPS function to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to a NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo. The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany... Within seconds, he receives an email on his Android that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Macbook Air, after a few minutes, receives a response. Finally, he simply opens the spreadsheet on his laptop, turns to the cowboy and says, \"You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.\" \"That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,\" says Bud. He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car. Then Bud says to the young man, \"Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?\" The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, \"Okay, why not?\" \"You're a Congressman for the U. S. Government,\" says Bud. \"Wow! That's correct,\" says the yuppie, \"but how did you guess that?\" \"No guessing required.\" Answered the cowboy. \"You showed up here even though nobody called you; You want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked.

Maximilian Steel was a space-criminal, one of the biggest scumbags in Andromeda-9 since the arrest of the notorious gangster Forty-Eyes. Steel was known for holding up large transportation shuttles and demanding ransom. It was no surprise that after years of dodging the Intergalactic Police Force, Steel managed to develop a hefty amount of money. On July 4,3055, Steel revealed a massive construct the size of the Moon, on it was a weapon with great concentrated power that could destroy a planet. The weapon was pointed at the capital of the Milky Way galaxy -- Earth-6, a behemoth, terraformed Jupiter, the center of governance and knowledge in the galaxy. Steel broadcasted to this massive planet, and demanded 300 trillion quarsecs or else the entire planet would be decimated. Helpless to do anything, the planet gave into Steel's demands and decided to give him all the money. Steel, being the scum that he was, fired his massive weapon anyways. The massive weapon was a beam of pure concentrated plutonium, with a power to destroy the planet in 30 minutes. The planet's military was in a panic, scrambling fighter ships and sending them in the hopes of destroying the weapon before it could do more damage. One fighter by the name of Jet had the idea of making the plutonium beam impact another object in space before reaching Earth-6. He thought of sending his fuel-cells in the line of the weapon, burning the plutonium in process and causing an explosion in space. Jet shot up into space, with the plutonium mass approaching him at a high speed. Jet threw his fuel-cells at the plutonium, but it's far too much power for the cells to handle... Jet's fuel can't melt Steel's beam.",

He was put on trial for the murder of nearly a hundred people. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by the electric chair. When asked what he'd like for his last meal, he replied simply with, \"A banana, if you will.\" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. The conductor ate the banana in regular fashion and braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen. However, after the electricity was activated, nothing happened to the conductor. The prison guard was shocked and, not knowing what to do, simply let him go unscathed. In a few days, the conductor was back to work. A few days after his return to the train business, he managed to derail yet another train, again killing nearly a hundred people but surviving the crash. As before, he was trialed and found guilty of mass murder. Again, he was sentenced to death by electric chair. It was the same prison guard as before. He was surprised to see the conductor again but held his tongue, for the man was about to die and it would be rude to question him. \"What would you like for your last meal, sir?\" The conductor respond as he did last time: \"A banana, if you will.\" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. The conductor ate the banana in regular fashion and braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen. The electricity was activated and the conductor was prepared. But, as before, the conductor was unhurt. The prison guard checked for any malfunctions but found nothing, not believing the entire situation was possible. In shock as before and not knowing what to do, the guard let the conductor go. The conductor was, against all odds, alive and was still allowed to continue his job as a train conductor even though he was responsible for the death of almost two hundred people. He was thankful to be allowed to continue his job but also scared. He would try not carefully from now on. However, this idea didn't help much as on the first train he was conducting after the chair, he managed to somehow crash yet another train. He was the only survivor of the train, which contained over a hundred people. He was trialed and, again, found guilty of the murder of over a hundred people. He was sentenced to death by electric chair. The prison guard was the same, the surprise was the same, the procedure was the same. After giving the banana to the conductor, the guard was silent. He couldn't bring himself to say anything, all he could do was prepare the chair. The man sat in the chair, expecting death. The guard activated it and, again, the conductor was unscathed. The prison guard couldn't contain himself. He simply had to ask, \"Sir, how did you manage to crash a train 3 times? And how did you survive the chair 3 times? Did the banana have something to do with it?\" The conductor responds with: \"No, I suppose I'm just not a good conductor.\"",

Bartender walks over and asks him what he will have, to which he responds he can't afford any. Asking, \"Damn it man, I've never been to a bar I couldn't manage a free drink out of a women.\" Bartender begins to laugh and explains the bar is pretty much all married ladies and there blue collar plant working husbands. Bartender: I tell you what buddy, if you can make our mascot that donkey over there laugh, I'll let you drink the entire night for free. The man looks over when a moment of inspiration hits him, what's the worst that happens the donkey doesn't laugh? The man walks over and simply whispers in the donkey's ear. As the bartender watches in amazement the donkey rolls over seemingly, \"ahh eee ahhing,\" to death. The man walks back over and tells the bartender, \"I'll take a knobb creak and a budweiser. Keep em coming.\" The bartender being a man of his word pays his debt, and the gentleman drinks the night away on the house. The following night the gentleman returns, and asks the bartender if the bet still stands. Bartender: I'll make the bet with ya, but this time make him cry. I don't mean calling and acting an ass, I mean legitimately crying. Gentleman: You've got yourself a bet. The gentleman walks off towards the mascot, with more confidence then should be allowed for such a silly bet. He stands in front of the donkey, back to the bar, fumbling in his pockets seemingly. The bartender concerned he is digging for a weapon runs over to stop the man. By the time he arrives the donkey has laid himself down, tears welling from its eyes and looking as if he had lost the will to live. Gentleman: I guess I won the bet again. Bartender: So it seems you did. Both walk back to the bar, the bartender more then confused how Dr. Doolittle here has managed these feats. Bartender: I'm a man of my word, but I'm honestly not gonna pay up this time unless you answer a couple questions. Gentleman: Sure, you've been more then a good sport. Bartender: How in the fuck did you make that donkey laugh? Gentleman: Well, it was easy. I walked up, took a quick study of the donkey, and whispered in his ear, \"Mines bigger.\" The bartender now laughing himself, asks, \"Ok, well how in the hell did you make him cry?\" Gentleman: Now that was even easier.

However, their manager got the dates wrong and the group ended up doing a three-day run in an outdoor theater in Albuquerque in the middle of the July heat. The event was exhausting and by the third night, everyone was just hoping to survive one more concert and move on. During the last song - Beethoven's Ninth - the bass players in the back of the orchestra hatch a plan. There's a bit in the middle of the song that's all violins and flutes, surely they won't be missed. They decide to sneak out to the bar next door for a drink, 'just to keep hydrated.' They stay a little longer than they should have, and drink a lot more than they would have, when one of them realizes that they are going to miss their entrance. The ring-leader of the group tells them to not worry, as he had the foresight to tie the last page of the score down with a bit of string. It will take the conductor a while to unite it, which means the concert will stop and they can sneak in. They drunkingly congratulate him for being so smart as they stumble back to the theater. Meanwhile, the conductor is in a bind. The very energetic end of the piece is coming up and his bass section is missing. The violinists are working up a sweat trying to keep up in the heat when suddenly the first violinist faints from heat exhaustion. This is the last straw for the second violinist and she faints too. The bass section begins stumbling in not so subtly as they are knocking people, instruments, and chairs over. To top it all off, someone has tied down the last page of the score as he is desperately trying to flip the page. It would do us good to sympathize with the conductor and put ourselves in his shoes. From his vantage point, he begins to realize that: There are two out, at the end of the ninth The score is tied And the basses are loaded.",

The Catholic is first. When the gates to Catholic Heaven open, they sees a less-than-ideal heaven. The Catholic says, \"God, you have taught me to be thankful for all that I have. I know that I should be thankful for what you give me in salvation.\" The Lutheran is next. The doors to Lutheran Heaven open up, and a place filled with happy people, but with homes of mud and clothes made of rags. The Lutheran says, \"God, I you have taught me to be thankful for everyone I have. I know that this is the true meaning of salvation.\" The Protestant is last. The doors to Protestant heaven open up to reveal a heaven that is absolutely perfect, to ones wildest dreams, but the entirety of it is covered in animal feces. The Protestant says, \"God, you have taught me to be strict and righteous. This is insulting and I believe you have forsaken me.\" St. Peter smiles at the three of them and says: \"That was a test of faith. Heaven is just past me.\" He looks at the Protestant. \"As for you, we realize that our test was decieving, but we know you have been a good person. So we are testing this idea: An imperfect heaven for those not perfectly faithful. Welcome to Lutheran heaven!\"",

When the camera closes up, we see that the guys are roman soldiers and the one in the middle is crucifying Jesus Christ. He turns to the camera and says: \"Wilson nails, so strong!\" The board finds this ad extremely offensive and politely tells the priest that they don't want to see cross and jesus in their ads. The next week, our priest comes with another video: Hundreds of men with helmet and shit are gathered around the Eiffel Tower. One banging a nail onto the tower. When the camera zooms in, we see that he crucifies Jesus Christ onto Eiffel Tower. He turns to the camera and says, \"Wilson Nails! Very effective! Even on metal!\" The board gets angry and politely says that he does not want any fucking crucifying in a fucking nail ad. The priest, for the last time brings another video a week after: The video starts. Nothing happens. Only a desert... Then, a man appears with beard and long hair. He screams and runs with blood all over himself. A few seconds later, shitloads of roman guys appear on the screen running as fast as they could.

Now behind the log there was a Cat, and the cat noticed that if the fly moved down about three inches, the fish would jump out of the water to get the fly and the bear would come out from behind the tree to catch the fish and the hunter would drop his cheese sandwich to shoot the bear and the mouse would come out of its log to eat the cheese sandwich and the cat could jump out from behind the log to get the mouse. SO, sure enough, the Fly moves down about three inches, the Fish jumpes out of the water, the Bear comes out from behind the tree, the Hunter droppes his sandwich, the Mouse comes out of the log, the Cat jumpes over the log to get the Mouse and misses and falls in the pond. TL/DR if the fly moves down about three inches, some pussy is gonna get wet.",

He tells everyone in earshot that if anyone puts a piece of wood in front of him, he can tell them what type of wood it is and where it came from just by smelling it, if they buy him a drink. The bartender says, \"okay,\" and accepts. A crowd is gathering and the old man is blindfolded and he places his hands behind his back. The bartender brings out a baseball bat from under the bar and says, \"Alright, what kind of wood is this?\" The old man bends over and gives the bat a long sniff. He stands upright and says, \"That wood is ash and it comes from Kentucky.\" The bartender is amazed and gives him a drink. A few minutes later a couple of redneck looking guys make him the same challenge. One of them goes out to his pickup truck and gets a 2 x 4. Again blindfolded with his hands behind his back the old man gives the 2 x 4 a great sniff. He declares, \"this is spruce and it is from Canada.\" The rednecks are amazed and get him a drink. A few minutes later an old old woman sitting at the end of the bar offers the old man the same challenge. The old man is blindfolded once more and places his hands behind his back. The old woman pulls an old wooden dildo out of her purse. The old man bends over and takes a mighty sniff. He snaps his head back up quickly grimacing. He bends over once more and gives another big sniff. Again his head snaps up and he grimaces. He then shakily says, \"I don't know what kind of wood it is, but I know it came off the shithouse door of a fishing boat.\"",

He decides that something must be done. Ten minutes into dinner, the man puts down his silverware. He proceeds to grab his girlfriend, throw her onto the table, tear off all her clothes, and ruthlessly pipe her out in front of both her parents. Once he is done, he glances at his girlfriend's father. Dad is clearly infuriated but says nothing. The meal continues. Another ten minutes pass and the man grabs his girlfriend's mother and repeats the task. Gives it to her in the strictest of biblical senses. Again, he looks at dad. Dad is beet red, seemingly read to pulverize the man. But he says nothing. They continue to eat. Suddenly, a great burst of thunder peals out and it begins to rain torrentially. \"Oh, shit, I need some Vaseline!\" The man exclaims. Dad recoils and raises his hands. \"That's OK.

Mel Famey of the Milwaukee Braves was a natural .. A once-in-a-lifetime phenom whose fast ball blew away the best hitters. His 90 MPH curveball would start out like it was going to hit the batter's ear, only to break at the last instant and hit the outside corner of the plate for a strike. His changeup made the best hitters in the league cry .. They would swing, drop the bat, and stare incredulously as the ball hit the catcher's mitt. He was indeed awesome! Why then, you might ask, is he not in the Hall of Fame? Why haven't you ever heard of him? Alas, like many others before him, Mel's downfall was .. Alcohol. Ol' Mel really liked to tilt the glass. His drinking became almost legendary around the country, but he never let it affect his pitching until... This happened. The Braves and the Yankees in the World Series! Excitement reigned! The series was tied at three games apiece, and the Braves were in New York for the seventh and deciding game. The night before the big event, Mel's thirst got the better of him. He snuck out of the hotel after curfew, and bought himself two cases of beer. As you might imagine, the next morning Mel didn't feel too good. But being the pro that he was, Mel managed to do just fine .. Until the bottom of the ninth inning. With the Braves ahead by one run, two out and the bases loaded, Mel's revelry the night before finally caught up to him. Eight straight pitches .. Eight straight balls. He walked in the tieing and the winning runs, losing the game and the series. After the game, a reporter went to the jubilant Yankee's clubhouse and spoke to the last two players that faced Mel. \"Tell me,\" he asked, \"to what do you attribute this victory over the best pitcher in the major leagues?\" In unison they replied, \"It was the beer that made Mel Famey walk us!\"",

Eventually the Cunt-Tree will be full of cunts and some of cunts will reach full maturity and start to fall and be noticed. When people notice that the cunt tree is full of cunts they shake the tree as the cunt fruit is known to spoil the soil and poison the animals. The bigger the Cunt-Tree, the more difficult it is to shake the cunts off or get rid of the tree completely. The people's rejoice over their victory over the cunts is short lived as the Cunt-Tree will inevitably grow back a new set of cunts. -Bluemountainbike.",

He is being charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math instruction. \"Al-gebra is a fearsome cult,\" Gonzales said. They desire average solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in a search of absolute value. They use secret code names like 'x' and 'y' and refer to themselves as unknowns, but we have determined they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country. As the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, \"There are 3 sides to every triangle.\" When asked to comment on the arrest, President Bush said, \"If God had wanted us to have better weapons of math instruction, He would have given us more fingers and toes.\"",

Every time he farted, it came out, \"hooonda.\" He flipped through the phone book and found an American doctor and rushed over. The doctor listened to his bizarre farts, examined him thoroughly then proclaimed he was completely stumped. He sent the salesman to a Japanese doctor that specialized in rare diseases, but this doctor too didn't have a clue. He made an emergency appointment with a gastroenterologist. He too was baffled. On his way out of the last doctor's office, he was panicking. He had to cancel the meeting. How embarrassing would it be if in the middle of the chairman of Toyota's office he let a fart slip and it came out, \"hooonda!\" Just before he went out of the office door, the receptionist called after him. \"The doctor recommends you try going to a dentist.\" \"A dentist?\" He thought. What the heck. He was desperate at this point so he called a local dentist. When he arrived and described his problem to the old Japanese dentist, the dentist nodded his head and said, \"you have abscessed tooth.\" \"An abscessed tooth?!?\" The incredulous salesman says. \"Why the hell do you say that?\" To which the dentist replied, \"Everybody knows abscess make the fart go Honda,.\"",

While he's going down on her, she keeps screaming, \"Naki Naki!\" As he slowly penetrates her, she still screams, \"Naki Naki!\" 'Wow', he thinks to himself while doing his thing 'this girl's pussy is the tightest thing I've ever felt!'. And when he starts to really pound her, the screams get even louder: \"Naki Naki! NAKI NAKI!\" The lawyer concludes that this must be an expression of great joy in Japanese. Even as they're coming to an amazing climax, her last words are \"... Naki.. Naki...\" Before she falls asleep on the bed. The next day the lawyer meets up with mr. Oki on the golf course. The lawyer thanks mr. Oki for an amazing night, and mr. Oki is pleased to see him in such a good mood now. The lawyer - pretty full of himself after his spectacular performance last night - proceeds to hit a hole-in-one. Cocky and proud to show off his newly learned Japanese, he exclaims: \"Yeah! Naki naki!\" To which mr. Oki, puzzled, looks at the lawyer and says to him: 'What do you mean, \"wrong hole.\" ?'.",

Well, they keep going like this, double or nothing after double or nothing, instrument after instrument, until finally the bartender is into the guy for 3200 dollars.

But we're not savages like we used to be, so we're not going to torture you for three days first... In fact, you can kill yourselves any way you like, we don't care.\" The explorers all look rather crestfallen at this news, and the chief hastens to reassure them: \"Oh, I know what you're thinking, we've seen it before --- you're thinking your life has been a waste, you're going to die out here for nothing, and so on. Well, let me assure you, that just isn't true. We'll use your skin to make our excellent canoes, your hair to make twine, and we'll eat every edible part of you. So really, it's not a waste at all. Now, please get on with it.\" The Frenchman chooses a rope and says, \"vive la france,\" and then hangs himself from a tree. The Englishman chooses a gun, says, \"God save the Queen,\" and shoots himself in the head. The New Yorker chhoses, \"death by fork.\" The King and the tribe think it an odd request but grant it and give him a fork. The guy from NY starts stabbing himself, all over his own body, it looks torturous and even the cannibals are stunned...

A driver is far too much club for this hole.\" Hesitantly, the golfer pulled out his 3 wood, made good contact with the ball, and the ball landed about 10 feet to the right front of the hole on the green. The golfer, delighted, turned to the robot and thanked him for his assistance.

I do believe this green will break right to left.\" Thinking about the last time the robot corrected his prediction, he decided again to listen to the machine.

His entire game was the best game he ever played, thanks to the assistance of the new robot golf caddie.

Upon entering, he turned to the man behind the counter and said, \"I would like 18 holes of golf and one of those robot golf caddies, please.\" The gentleman from behind the counter turned to the man and said, \"Well the 18 holes is no problem. However, we no longer have the robots. We had too many complaints.\" Confused, the golfer cried, \"COMPLAINTS? Who in the heck could've complained about those robots? They were incredible.\" The man sighed and said, \"Well, it wasn't their performance. It was that they were made of shiny silver metal, and the sun reflecting off them was blinding to other golfers on the fair way.\" The golfer said, \"So then why didn't you just paint them black?\" The man nodded sadly and replied, \"We did.

One Sunday was a picture-perfect day for golfing. The sun was out, no clouds were in the sky, and the temperature was just right. The preacher was in a quandary as to what to do, and shortly, the urge to play golf overcame him. He called an assistant to tell him that he was sick and could not do church, packed the car up, and drove three hours to a golf course where no one would recognize him. Happily, he began to play the course. An angel up above was watching the preacher and was quite perturbed. He went to God and said, \"Look at the preacher. He should be punished for what he is doing.\" God nodded in agreement. The preacher teed up on the first hole. He swung at the ball, and it sailed effortlessly through the air and landed right in the cup 250 yards away. A picture-perfect hole-in-one. He was amazed and excited. The angel was a little shocked. He turned to God andsaid, \"I beg your pardon, but I thought you were going to punish him.\" God smiled. \"Think about it-who can he tell?\"",

He has brought ten apples with him, and the cannibal leader explains to him that he must fit all of the fruit in his butt without making any noise or they will kill him. The man tries but on the 4th apple he squeals and they kill him. Then the second man returns with blueberries. The cannibals tell him the same thing and he starts to put the blueberries in his butt. He gets to the 9th berry and bursts out laughing so they kill him. In heaven the first man asks the second man why he died if he only had blueberries to fit into his butt and the man respondes, \"I was almost there but I cracked up when I saw the last guy coming back with pineapples.\"",

Once he makes it past the sliding doors in his dashiki, he asks the receptionist, \"Which doctor gave me ebola?\" The woman's face pales, her hands begin to quiver, and she dials the phone rapidly. After a proper diagnosis is made by medical officials, he is rushed into a secure room in a secluded area of the hospital. Several doctors enter the room wearing hazmat suits. Once the doors are sealed shut, the man screams in a thick African accent, \"Which doctor gave me ebola!?\" The frightened and slightly confused doctors strap the man down to a hospital bed. The ebola patient jerks around in the bed screaming, \"Which doctor gave me ebola!?\" Shocked and mortified by the possibility of the virus spreading through the hospital staff, the hospital administrator orders the premises to be quarantined. Top-notch ebola experts are brought in to question the man. Determined to find the source of the illness, the African ebola patient is interrogated for several hours by the experts, but his response to every question is, \"Which doctor gave me ebola!?\" The man flails and kicks about in frustration and anger, and the medical staff become more impatient. After several days pass, the ebola experts finally lose their patience and give up. The man is left alone in the room in critical condition. Another day passes, and an African nurse walks in to check up on the man. The ebola patient is dying, and he can barely speak. He reaches out and grasps the nurse's hand with a soft touch. With his final breath, he whispers softly. \"Witchdoctor... Gave me... Ebola...\"",

Every morning before work: \"Scoobie doobie doobie- I want bigger boobies.\" After a few weeks it begins to work! She is thrilled! She wakes late one morning, forgetting her mantra, and rushes to the bus. She doesn't want to miss a day... So she goes to the back of the bus and whispers while rubbing her chest, \"scoobie dooboe doobie- I want bigger boobies.\" A man leans over to her and asks... \"Hey!

Please!\" St. Peter said, \"I'm sorry, but there's only one way you can go back, and that is as a chicken.\" Bob was devastated, but begged St. Peter to send him to a farm near his home... The next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking, and pecking the ground. A rooster strolled past. \"So, you're the new hen, huh? How's your first day here?\" \"Not bad,\" replied Bob the hen, \"but I have this strange feeling inside. Like I'm gonna explode!\" \"You're ovulating,\" explained the rooster. \"Don't tell me you've never laid an egg before?\" \"Never,\" said Bob. \"Well, just relax and let it happen,\" says the rooster. \"It's no big deal.\" Bob did, and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg! Bob was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood. He soon laid another egg -- his joy was overwhelming. As he was about to lay his third egg, he felt a smack on the back of his head, and heard his wife yelling... \"BOB, wake up for fucksake,\" You've just shit the bed! \"",

Steve and his wife had sex every single night and had never been apart from one another since they tied the knot. One evening though Steve came home from work and said, \"Darling, I have some bad news. My company has ordered I go on a business trip for the next two months. I'm going to miss you dearly and I know you're going to miss me. Is there anything I can do for you before I leave?\" \"Well,\" says Steve's wife, \"you know how we have sex every single night?\" \"Yes I know dear.\" Said Steve. \"Well dear husband I want you to go out and buy me a dildo so I can have something to keep me company.\" Steve agrees and goes to the dildo shop. He looks around at all the dildos and sees big ones and small ones and ones with plugs and ones with sparkles. He approaches the shop keep and explains his predicament. \"Well that seems like a tall order,\" the shop keep says, \"two months is a long time for a woman to stay faithful and a hard job for one dildo to do. But I think I've got just the thing.\" The shop keep reaches under his counter and pulls out a box. Steve opens the box to find what appears to be just an ordinary dildo. \"Whats so special about this one?\" Asks Steve. \"Watch this!\" Replies the shop keep, \"I can command it. Voodoo Dildo! The door!\" And just then what seemed to be an ordinary dildo levitates from the box, travels to the door, and thunderously penetrates the keyhole. \"Remarkable!\" Says Steve. \"Now watch this!\" Says the shop keep, \"Voodoo Dildo! The pocket pussies!\" And the Voodoo Dildo switches from the keyhole to fucking the pocket pussies on display in the store. \"Sensational!\" Says Steve. Finally the shop keep stops the Voodoo Dildo by saying, \"Voodoo Dildo! Return!\" And the Voodoo Dildo levitated back to the box. Steve is very impressed by this magical sex toy and gladly purchases it from the store. Steve returns home with the box in hand eager to greet his wife and show off her new present. When he arrives he sees that she has gone to the grocery store. He leaves the package on their bed with instructions hes written on how to activate the Voodoo Dildo. Later in the evening Steve has gone to the airport and his wife has returned home. She spots the package left by her husband and without hesitation begins to open it. Inside she finds the Voodoo Dildo and Steves instructions. After reading the instructions she strips off all of her clothes and says, \"Well I guess we should see what this is all about. Voodoo dildo! My pussy!\" And the Voodoo Dildo begins to give her the best she's ever had. It starts slow but eventually makes her come again and again. After her fourth orgasm she thinks shes had enough but oh no! Steve forgot to include how to make the Voodoo Dildo stop! She tries pulling it and grabbing it but it wont stop. She calls 911 but the operator tells her not to make prank calls on the emergency hotline. She rushes to find anything she can to stop it but it just wont. She climaxes again and finally decides to put on her clothes and drive to the hospital. Once shes in her car she can barely drive. Shes rushing to the hospital but is swerving and turning due to her reoccuring orgasms. A police cruiser notices this and pulls her over. She reluctantly pulls to the side of the road as she climaxes again. The cop asks her to roll down her window and she explains the whole story to the cop. After her long explanation and hurried story the skeptical policeman rolls his eyes, looks at her, and says, \"Yeah right. Voodoo dildo my ass.\"",

So that they can get a clear shot off on the gorilla so they don't harm the pelt as that would bring down its value, they have a dog that bites the gorilla's balls to stun it. To get the gorilla out of the tree they have some one climb up with bananas to attract it, and a club to hit it over the head once it is close enough. When they have the dog and net ready, the send the newbie up the tree to get the gorilla out. He pulls out the bananas, and the gorilla starts to swing closer to him.

The gorilla siezes the opportunity and grabs the bananas and in the process knocks the man out of the tree. As he is falling the only thing he can think to scream out is, \"SHOOT THE DOG!

The sandwiches were made out of fresh baked bread, with homemade butter, cheese, ham, and fresh vegetables: Tomatoes, lettuce and cucumbers. Eating them was his favorite part od the day, and he treated them as a reward for hard work he did. One day the peasant went to work in the field and left his sandwiches on a nearby rock as he always did. After a few hours of work, he took a break and headed to the rock to enjoy his lunch, but... It was gone! A little angry and confused, he went back to work. The next day began and it was passing by as usual. Until the lunch time, when the poor man came to the rock to find out his sandwiches disappeared again! He got angry, but there was not much he could do, so he returned to work. On the third day, the situation occured again. It was too much. This time the peasant got really pissed and decided that the next day he would hide behind a tree and wait to reveal the sandwiches thief. He did as he decided. He was waiting well hidden, keeping an eye on his lunch, but there was no living soul around. After an hour, suddenly, a great eagle flew out of nowhere, grabbed the lunch with it's claws and started to fly away. The shocked peasant threw himself into a pursuit of the bird. He followed the eagle until it landed in a nearby forest, not aware of being followed. The peasant hid behind a tree and watched the eagle. The bird unpacked the sandwiches and threw all of the ingredients out: Ham, cheese and fresh vegetables.

This particular time she is really chewing him out saying she doesn't get laid enough and she has finally decided to divorce him and take half his things. The businessman pleads for his wife to stay, saying he will do anything for her. She asks him to make love to her right then and there but suddenly his phone rings. It's his boss and he tells the businessman to get to the airport in an hour for a very important deal which he cannot refuse. The wife loses her shit and the business man knows he can't stay but he tells her he will make it up to her somehow. He gets in the car and starts to drive to the airport. On the way he is freaking out knowing his wife is going to do something crazy while he's away. He stops at a red light and looks over to see a sex shop. A lightbulb goes off in his head and he parks and runs into the store. The little bell rings as he enters and he looks around. DVD's, whips, chains, lube, latex suits, mask, dildo. The man is completely overwhelmed so he rings the bell at the counter. A woman walks out from the back and the businessman asks for the most expensive item they carry in the store and that the price is of no concern. The lady take a box out from under the counter, it is covered in dust which she blows off and she opens it. Inside is a piece of wood, whittled into the crude shape of a cock. The businessman looks at the item, perplexed and confused and asks WTH is it suppose to be and how much does it cost. The lady says it is the legendary voodoo dick and it will cost him over 5000$. The businessman becomes outraged and asks why that pathetic looking wooden dildo is 5000$ and the dildo under the counter with a lube dispenser, rotating head and twelve speeds costs only 200$ the lady tells him the powers of the voodoo dick are not to be underestimated and gives him a demonstration. She leans in and tells the voodoo dick to fuck the female customer by the dvd rack. The voodoo dick starts to float out of the box the flies full speed across the store, up the womans dress and starts to fuck her silly, knocking DVD's all over the ground. She tells the voodoo dick to stop fucking the female customer and it flies back into the box and the lid magically closes. The business man slaps the money on the counter and buys it right away. He rushes home and gives his wife the gift and instructions then leaves for the airport, confident he just saved his marriage. For the first day the wife just looks at the box insulted her husband would get her a dildo. The second day she has some thoughts about using it but doesn't and on the third day she is watching Dr. Phil and decides 'fuckit' then brings the box into the bedroom and gets on the bed and takes the voodoo dick out of the box. She tells the voodoo dick to fuck her and it flies right into her pussy and gives her five orgasms in a minute. She can't take it anymore and tells the voodoo dick to stop but it continues its rampage inside her vagina. She freaks out and tries to put her clothes back on but she falls all over the place, when she finally manages to do that she goes into the garage and tries to get into her car. Fumbling and dropping her keys a few times she gets in and drives as fast as she can to the hospital. She is swerving and speeding until she sees the cherries of a cop car in her rearview mirror. She pulls over and this state trooper looking cop comes up to her window and taps on the glass with his flashlight. She rolls down her window and the cop asks her why she was speeding and tells her she could've killed someone, he demands to know an explanation for all of the reckless driving and she tells him about the voodoo dick. The cop looks at her with a stern expression, takes off his glasses, looks her right in the eyes and goes, \"Voodoo dick my ASS.\"",

Arty, who hates John's wife says he'll do it for a measly 1 dollar. John can't refuse this counter-offer and the deal is settled upon. One fateful evening, Arty takes John's keys and enters the home with a 9mm to shoot his wife. He approaches her from behind and attempts to pull the trigger, but the gun is locked up. John's wife turns around, and before she can scream, Arty strangles her to death. He leaves her corpse, panics and runs. On the way down the stairs, the maid notices him in his ski mask and begins to let out a shreak! Arty wraps his hands around her neck and kills her in the same manner. The old butler sees Arty kill the maid and rushes for the door. His old legs moving at their quickest pace. Arty makes up the ground and cuts off the man's life source by again, strangling him.

The Doctor thinks for a moment and says, \"Hmm, tricky situation.

When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my dick I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina.\" The husband nods and gives his approval.

After a few gentle strokes, the doctor says, \"I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper.\" So the doctor goes deeper.

This monkey is smoking a huge joint, the salamander yells, \"hey! Monkey! Smells like some good ass weed you got,\" the monkey looked down, startled.. And said, \"hell yeah! C'mon up man have a puff!\" So the salamander made his way up the tree, took a few fat rips and coughed his ass off. \"Monkey! That shit is the SHIT!\" The salamander exclaimed. \"But... I have dry mouth so bad now man! Sandpaper!\" So the monkey pointed to the left and said, \"go over that little hill and through the bushes. You'll find a nice cool stream to drink out of.\" So he made his way over the hill, and through the bushes down to the stream. He started drinking away with his eyes closed. After a satisfying drink, he opened his and eyes and WHOA! He was face to face with a big ass alligator. The alligator spoke before he could.. \"Salamander... Looks like you have been chiefin some fine ass weed! Where may I ask did you partake?\" \"Through those bushes and over the hill, there is a nice monkey in a tree. He will smoke you up!\" \"Thank you man,\" replied the alligator. And he started walking, through the bushes and over the hill. It took him a few minutes but he followed the smell and at last saw the monkey up in a tree. The monkey looked down and saw the alligator and said, \"FUUUUUCK DUDE!

First, he asked some lady alongside the road if she would sex him up in exchange for his bird. She punched him in the mouth. This happened several times with bodily injury always being the result. Finally, the son staggered into a laudromat a few miles from home and saw a pretty lady doing some laundry. He asked, \"Excuse me miss, would be willing to have sex with me in exchange for this duck?\" The duck quacked. The woman was at first angry and about to punch him but realized that times were tough and that was one bitching looking bird. So she agreed and took him into the back room of the laundromat. The two of them proceeded to have sex and the now dazed son gave her the duck, per the prior agreement. When handed the duck, she hesitated and said, \"Hey, how about I trade you this duck back and we go have sex again?\" The son gasps and flails and takes his bird back and sprints with the woman to bump uglies for a second time. The woman is happy and sends the son home with her address and phone number. The dazed and foggy son takes his prized waterfowl directly out of the laundromat and is promptly run over by a truck. Luckily, he is ok but the duck is smashed and killed. The driver hops out and says, \"Gee, I sure am sorry. That seemed like a nice duck. Here is 50 cents to help you buy a new one.\" The boy happily accepts the money since it is a huge amount for that period and walks merrily home. Upon arriving the farmer sees his happy son in the setting dusk and asks him, \"Well son, how was your day?\" The son smiles enormously and says, \"Well dad, I gave a duck for a fuck.

He ran into the desert and saw a band of people readying themselves to rape the woman, he quickly pulled out his gun and fired a few shots into the air. This caused the band to get back into their car and drive off. The man then went to the woman and asked if all was well. She replied, \"Oh, my hero, you saved me, I will do anything for you.\" \"GGGGREAT, the man replied,\" will you please hold my camel a second. \"",

He heads to the port's birdkeep, and finds the perfect talkative parrot perched on its swing within. The keeper discloses, however, that the bird was born with no legs, among another odd birth defect. Doubloon of course inquires, \"How he be a'holdin 'is ground?\" Smartly, the parrot replied, \"Awk! With me yardarm of course,\" to which the parrot opens his wings and reveals his other birth defect, his wraparound length tally-whacker. The captain is amazed at the impressive appendage, and of course considers the parrot perfect among his mangy and motley crew. Captain Loony Doubloon and the newly-monikered Tiltin Yardarm fast become talkative mates, and the captain wastes no time in warning his feathery friend of his cunning and lecherous first mate, Rusty Pegleg. \"A foul bosom's mate he is, he'll steal your wench from ye as soon as he'd steal the bung from its hole!\" They voyage on, and at the next port the crew finds a slew of horny wenches, of which the captain always gets the first pick. Doubloon immediately picks the sauciest wench of the bunch, taking well into account as Rusty Pegleg drools at the mere sight of her. The captain keeps his lady waiting in his quarters while he settles with the mistress of the brothel, betting his first mate wouldn't be brazen enough to plunder the Captain's choice pick with Tiltin Yardarm bearing witness. However, when the Captain returns, his wench is gone, and Yardarm begins to squawk a terrible account. Loony Doubloon is incensed, -\"What transpired 'ere, and where's me choice wench?!\" \"Awk! Rusty Pegleg is all to blame, I swear me Cap'n!\" This further infuriates Doubloon, -\"Tell yer every bit of it or I'll 'ave ye defeathered 'n tarred!\" Titltin musters his courage, -\"Awk! He burst through the door and thrust her to the bed!\" The captain now is boiling. \"And then what 'appened?!\" His parrot begins to quiver. \"Awk! She moaned and begged him to drop his anchor!\" Doubloon unsheathes his cutlass in a fit of anger, pointing at his feathery witness, -\"Spare no detail or it's yer life!\" Shivering, his misplaced target of anger musters, -\"Awk! She was clawing for him to take her, begging him, pleading him 'Oh captain, Oh captain!'\" To this, the maddened Captain Loony Doubloon thrusts the tip of his blade to the edge of the poor parrot's neck, -\"Every bloody detail or yer to walk the plank and find Davey Jones locker with 'im!\" Tiltin Yardarm swallows heavily and replies, -\"I can't bear witness to what happened next.

On this planet there was a mountain, and atop the mountain was a tree which hosted the most delicious fruit known the the Trid race. But there was a problem: There was a cave near the top that was home to a monster, and every time the trids tried to climb to the top of the mountain, the monster would run out and kick them all back down. The trids became tired of this, and so they contacted Earth to ask for help. Earth didn't find this to be that big of a problem as they were at war and dealing with many different things, so they sent over a rabi. The Trids were happy to have any help they could get, and so they gladly accepted. The rabbi arrived and wanted to get straight to business, calling all of the Trids to the base of the mountain. A lot of them were too frightened, so only some showed up. The rabi led the Trids most of the way up the mountain, only to have the monster come out and kick all of the Trids down but not the rabbi. Frustrated, the rabbi went to the Trid village and told them that in order to get to the top, they would all have to show up and work together. The next day more Trids showed up, but not all of them were there. The rabbi sighed, leading them up to have the monster once again kick down all of the trids, but leave him standing. The rabbi went back to the Trid village and told them that if every single last Trid wasn't in attendence the following day, he would return to Earth without helping them. The next day, every single Trid was there. The rabbi smiled and started leading the Trids up the mountain, this time quite confident that they would make it all the way up. But as usual, the monster ran out of his cave and managed to kick every single Trid back down the mountain, once again leaving the rabbi standing. The rabbi went to the monster's cave and asked, \"Monster, why do you only ever kick down the trids, but always leave me standing?\" To which the monster replied, \"Silly rabbi, kicks are for Trids.\"",

He doesn't want to intrude, but he figures she might need some help. \"Excuse me, miss. Why are you crying?\" He asks. She responds, \"I'm just so sad! I've never been kissed before and I don't guess I ever will!\" The guy feels uncomfortable but decides, \"what the hell,\" and kisses her full on the mouth, big sloppy kiss. \"Thank you, I feel so much better now!,\" The girl says as the guy continues his run on down the beach. The next day on his morning run the guy sees the same girl, still armless, still legless, sitting on the beach crying her eyes out. The guy is a little peeved to see the girl repeating her routine from the day before so he runs up to her again to confront her. \"Why are you crying now? I kissed you yesterday and you felt better!\" \"I know,\" she replied, \"but I've just gotten really upset thinking about how I've never been fingered before!\" The guy feels really strange about fingering a girl on the beach, especially one with no arms or legs, but he decided there'd be no harm. After a good fingering session, he takes off down the beach on his run again, followed by the heartfelt, \"thank you's!\" From the girl on the beach. The next day while out running again, the guy sees the same girl lying on the beach, crying, crying, crying. \"What is it now, for chrissakes? I kissed you, I fingered you! What more do you want?!,\" The guy asks. \"I was just upset,\" the girl said, \"because I've never been fucked.\" The guy leans in, picks her up, and throws her into the ocean. \"You're fucked now, aren't you?\"",
