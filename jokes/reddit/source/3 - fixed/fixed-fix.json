His dick is literally hanging to his knees, so naturally the guy asks the old man: \"How did you achieve that huge of a dick?\" \"Oh,\" says the old man, \"every morning I put some weights on it so it streches out, about 500 grams right on the tip.\" Next morning the guy remembers the old mans advice and puts 500 gram weight on his dick. Day goes past, and what do you know - his dick is streched to his knees, but the man wants more. Next day he puts a 800gram weight on his cock - and in the evening his dick is stretched to his ankles - but once again, he wants more. The day after he goes and puts 1kg of weight on his dick - after work he checks the length, and its now much longer then the old mans at the shower, basically dragging at the floor. So then he decides that its time to test it out and surprise his wife with his size - but, to his and hers dismay, he can't get it up, no matter how hard he tries. The next day the guy comes to the shower to ask the old man how does he manages to use it. He comes to the guy and says: \"I did what you suggested, and it worked - not only my dick was hanging at my knees like yours, but I got it even bigger - right to the floor, but now it doesn't go up when I need it to, how the fuck do you manage to use it?\" \"I don't know,\" says the old man, \"I use it to wipe my ass, so I guess with your length you can brush your teeth with it.\"",

When he arrives, the first thing he sees is a giant glass jar in the far corner of the room, 7 feet by 6 feet, packed to the brim with $10 bills. He sits down and asks his buddies, \"What's with the jar?\" \"No idea,\" responds his friend, so the man asks the bartender. In his thick Irish accent, \"Ah, ye warnt a know bout the haus game does yer? That'll be $10.\" Annoyed but intrigued, the man pulls out a $10 and lays it on the bar, and the old man begins, \"To win all the money in that there jar, I have a gallon jug of tequila ya hafta take all down at one go and not flinch or make a face,\" then he points to the back door, \"I have a pit bull chained out back with an aching tooth ya gotta pull, but watch out, she's mean as a blarney so be careful, and at last, I gots a 90 year old lass upstairs, who's never had an orgasm in her life. You gotta go up there and make things right for her.\" The man stands, shakes his head as he returns the table. \"I understand!\" Yells the bartender, \"But yer $10 stays in the jar.\" So the guy get into a bit of a drinking session with his buddies, but can't stop thinking about the jar. If he could suck it up, just for one night, he could change his life. Finally, with enough liquid courage, he stumbles up the the bar and slams down a $10 bill. \"Gimme the tequila.\" The bartender hands him the jug and he throws it back as hard as he can, throats burning, tears rolling down his face, he finishes every drop and slams it down, without making a face. The bartender points to the door, now the man staggers through the backdoor, and the barking ensues, trash cans are crashing, there's a loud scream then silence. \"Awh geez says the bartender, they fuckin' killed each other.\" As he shoos the crowd back he gets to the door, the man bursts thru, shirt shredded, bloodied and bruised, he shouts, \"Alright, now where's the old lady with the sore tooth?!\"",

Vinny stands in front of the judge and the judge says, \"Ok Vinny, before you become an American citizen I have to ask you a few questions about American history.\" Vinny very confidently says, \"Hey, not a problem judge.\" As he looks back to his family, he can see that they are all very excited and waiting with eager anticipation. The judge says, \"Ok Vinny, who was the first president of the United States?\" Vinny responds, \"Oh judge, that's-a easy one... George-a Washington!\" Immediately Vinny's whole family stands up and erupts into applause. You can hear, \"Hey Vinny!\" \"That-a boy!\" \"Way to go!\" The judge puts his hands up, \"Ok, ok, everybody calm down... Second question, when was the Declaration of Independence signed?\" Vinny confidently pulls on his collar a bit, put his hands out in front of him, and says, \"Judge, another easy one... 1776!\" Once again his family erupts, making more noise than the last time. \"Way to go Vinny!\" \"That-a boy!\" \"Calm down, calm down,\" says the judge. At this point Vinny is pretty confident. He is looking back at his family, giving them a couple of, \"Hey-yo, howya doins,\" and they are loving it. It seems as if the judge has lost all control of the courtroom. The family is on their feet and Vinny is in love with himself. The judge says, \"Ok Vinny last question.\" \"Not-a problem judge.\" Vinny replies. The judge kind of smirks, knowing there is no way that Vinny gets this one. He says, \"Who assassinated Abraham Lincoln?\" The crowd goes silent. Vinny is looking around with his head down, clearly very distraught. It becomes very apparent that Vinny will not get the answer to this one. Vinny nervously grabs his collar and replies, \"Hey-a judge... Well I-a... I don't know that one.\" His family erupts in the biggest uproar of the night. People are now jumping up and down in excitement. It seems as if the clock just his midnight on New Years Day. The judge is banging his gavel, completely confused as to what is going on. Vinny turns to his family and raises his hands high in the air as if he just won a grand prize. From deep within the crowd you hear a voice shout out with great pride... \"That-a boy Vinny! Don't-a squeal on-a nobody!\"",

He calls Moonchild over: You've been a very good hippy spreading peace and love, it's cloud number 6 for you... And ushers him in. Next he calls over Safron: You have been a very naughty hippy, Safron. Taking drugs, sleeping with everyone, and worst of all you thoought peace and love was a load of shite... And he ushers her off to the highway to hell. Poor Moonchild sits on his cloud miserable and alone, and can't believe he'll spend eternity without his true love. One day Jesus is walking past his cloud and see's how truly sad Moonchild is. 'If you're a good hippy angel after a year and a day I will allow you to go down to hell to visit Safron... But be careful now; Hell is a terrible place!' Overjoyed Moonchild spends everyday practising the harp, polishing his cloud and focusing on his flying lessons. A year soon passes and Jesus leads him to the big escalator down to hell. 'Take care Moonchild and remember you only have 24 hours'. As the escalator takes him down to the firey pits Moonchild scans the faces of the tormented until he see Safron waiting for him with a big smile on her face. The two lovers are happily reunited and Safron shows he lover around Hell. Casino's, nightclubs, free alcohol and drugs, free girls, no STD's, no hangovers, and endless money... Moonchild can't believe it. This is Hell? Safron even has her own strip club and the pair spend a wild night coked up and loved up - no shame, no guilt, no consequences. As dawn breaks Safron walks Moonchild back to the escalator and bids him a teary farewell and they promise to meet in a year and a day. When Moonchild gets back to heaven Jesus is there to meet him: How was it my son, was it difficult to witness such evil? Oh Yes, Jesus sir, such a bad, bad place. So aweful, says Moonchild hiding his smile. Well, says Jesus, off you go to harp lessons and say a hail Mary as you go... Oh and by the way: Where is your harp? Moonchild suddenly realises the last time he saw it it was flattened under 6 dirty, fire-breathing whores last night. Ah well, says, Moonchild 'I left my harp in Safran's Disco'... Get it? I left my heart in San Francisco... No? Ok, I'll apologise now and get my coat.",

He educated himself as much as he could on how to run a farm. He bought a farm, and buys a heard of sheep. Everything is going well, the sheep are properly housed and fed. The sheep are all grazing and seem fit all season. But when it came to sheering the sheep something went horribly wrong, the sheep's wool was coming out all tough and stringy. When the young man tried to sell the wool he was told it was worthless. A buyer examined the wool and asked; \"Did you chum the sheep?\" The young man had no idea what the buyer meant. He figured it was just some slang he never heard before for feeding and grazing the sheep. The buyer said the wool was worthless and he had to throw it away. To recover some of his loss the young farmer decided to slaughter some of the sheep. So he took a few sheep to the butcher who said; \"The meat on these sheep is tough to the bone. It's worthless. Did you chum the sheep?\" And young man had no idea what the butcher meant so he asked what chumming the sheep meant. \"To fuck it, of course,\" said the butcher. The young man was shocked and said the butcher was kidding. The butcher didn't smile at all and was dead serious. \"You gotta chum the sheep lad,\" said the butcher, \"If you don't chum the sheep, the sheep get upset and the wool comes out all stringy. The meat gets too tough to eat.\" The young man said even if he could fuck the sheep he couldn't possibly fuck the whole heard. The butcher said relax, he could hire a professional sheep chummer. Everyone in the county hired sheep chummers. So the young farmer asked how much it cost to hire professional sheep chummer. $20/hour. That seemed steep to the young farmer, but the butcher said. \"They're from Wales, lad, that's the most they can afford to pay ye,\" said the butcher. So the young farmer calls a sheep chummer who shows up the next day, an old man from Wales. \"Aye, I'm here to chum the sheep,\" he said. So the young farmer points out the heard and the old man has at it. He chummed the whole heard in just over two hours. All of a sudden the sheep's wool was vastly improved, the butcher said the meat was as tender as he ever saw. The young farmer as astonished how effective it was and he asked the butcher when did people discover sheep chumming was so effective? The butcher said it was shortly after people from Wales discovered two brand new uses for sheep. \"What was that?\" Asked the young farmer. \"Wool and meat,\" said the butcher.",

After thirteen months of sailing the seven seas, a battle-worn schooner filled to the brim with booty and booze makes port in the rag-tag pirate isle of Tortuga. The captain - a buccaneer known the world over for his utter lack of mercy, his terrible greed, and his hearty girth - lumbers off of the ship and, as per tradition, makes a beeline for the nearest hard-hitting watering hole. Upon stepping into the tavern, he is immediately greeted by the barkeep, who is a close friend of his. \"Captain!\" The man cries out in delight, \"It's wonderful to see ye again in these waters, ol' boy!\" He puts down the clay mug that he's wiping and walks towards his friend, arms open wide in welcome. However, before he gets close enough to embrace his customer, he doubles back in shock, almost tripping over a table behind him. \"Fuck!\" He yelps, \"What happened to yer leg, man?!\" The pirate captain looks down at the wooden pole stretching from his right knee and shakes his head in memory. \"Aye,\" he replies solemnly, \"That's a story, that is. Me 'n me crew, we're sailin' off the shore of Montego Bay with a hull full o' fresh Jamaican slaves when a heavily armed merchant vessel comes right up to our starboard side, tellin' us that we've gotta let go of our cargo 'cause we've got their employer in there. But we ain't lettin' go of one slave, no way, so we tell 'em to fuck off or we'll send 'em right down to ol' Davy, but no, they don't listen. In fact, they fucking fire one of their cannons as a warnin' shot, and it fuckin' blows me leg clean off!\" \"Golly!\" The barkeep gasps, \"That must've been right bloody painful!\" \"It sure was. But we showed 'em, we did. They took me leg, but I'm an honest man, ye see, I don't go back on me word. So we sent 'em right down to 'ol Davy.\" \"Masterful work, captain!\" The barkeep applauds. However, he quickly goes quiet again, his eyes moving from the peg leg to... \"But captain,\" he says, \"What happened to yer hand?\" The pirate looks down at the hook curving from his severed wrist and shakes his head in memory. \"Aye,\" he replies solemnly, \"That's a story, that is. Me 'n me crew, we were sailing 'cross the Moru Passage when another crew, one of 'em bastard Welsh sons o' sea-cucumbers that dare call 'emselves buccaneers, and they go on demandin' our booty. MY booty! The fuckin' gall! D'you have any idea what we had to go through to get that there treasure? So we tell 'em to fuck off, or we'll pin their gizzards to the masts, but no, they don't listen! They just go right on an' board us, and one of 'em ninnies chops me hand off with that puny cutlass of his!\" \"Golly!\" The barkeep gasps again, \"That must've been right bloody painful!\" \"It sure was. But we showed 'em, we did. They took me hand, but I'm an honest man, ye see, I don't go back on me word. So we cut 'em right up and pinned their gizzards to the masts.\" \"Masterful work, captain!\" The barkeep applauds once more. However, he quickly goes quiet again, his eyes moving from the hook to... \"But captain,\" he says, \"What happened to yer eye?\" The pirate touches the patch covering his empty socket and shakes his head in memory. \"Aye,\" he says, \"That's a story, that is.

Mel Famey of the Milwaukee Braves was a natural .. A once-in-a-lifetime phenom whose fast ball blew away the best hitters. His 90 MPH curveball would start out like it was going to hit the batter's ear, only to break at the last instant and hit the outside corner of the plate for a strike. His changeup made the best hitters in the league cry .. They would swing, drop the bat, and stare increduously as the ball hit the catcher's mitt. He was indeed awesome! Why then, you might ask, is he not in the Hall of Fame? Why haven't you ever heard of him? Alas, like many others before him, Mel's downfall was .. Alcohol. Ol' Mel really liked to tilt the glass. His drinking became almost legendary around the country, but he never let it affect his pitching until... This happened. The Braves and the Yankees in the World Series! Excitement reigned! The series was tied at three games apiece, and the Braves were in New York for the seventh and deciding game. The night before the big event, Mel's thirst got the better of him. He snuck out of the hotel after curfew, and bought himself two cases of beer. As you might imagine, the next morning Mel didn't feel too good. But being the pro that he was, Mel managed to do just fine .. Until the bottom of the ninth inning. With the Braves ahead by one run, two out and the bases loaded, Mel's revelry the night before finally caught up to him. Eight straight pitches .. Eight straight balls. He walked in the tieing and the winning runs, losing the game and the series. After the game, a reporter went to the jubilant Yankee's clubhouse and spoke to the last two players that faced Mel. \"Tell me,\" he asked, \"to what do you attribute this victory over the best pitcher in the major leagues?\" In unison they replied, \"It was the beer that made Mel Famey walk us!\"",

After much prayer and consideration they determined that the squirrels were predestined to be there and they shouldn't interfere with God's divine will. In The BAPTISTCHURCH the squirrels had taken up habitation in the baptistery. The deacons met and decided to put a cover on the baptistery and drown the squirrels in it. The squirrels escaped somehow and there were twice as many there the next week The MethodistChurch got together and decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God's creation. So, they humanely trapped the Squirrels and set them free a few miles outside of town. Three days later, the squirrels were back. But, the Catholic Church came up with the best and most effective solution. They baptized the squirrels and registered them as members of the church. Now they only see them on Christmas, Ash Wednesday, Palm Sunday and Easter. Not much was heard about the Jewish Synagogue, but they took one squirrel and had a short service with him called circumcision and they haven't seen a squirrel on the property since.",

One night while they're out on the town, the shorter midget decides they should find some hookers and take them back to their rooms. The taller midget is really horny after watching the show-girls, so they finish their drinks and leave the bar in search of some street walkers. When they finally get back to their rooms, the taller midget tells his hooker he wants a blow job first, so she starts sucking and stroking. But because he's had a little too much to drink he can't get it up, and because he can't get it up and he's drunk, he starts yelling at her and calling her a dirty whore, so she gets dressed and leaves. Then he hears some noise coming from the shorter midget's room, so he gets a glass and puts it on the wall to listen in. He hears the shorter midget call out, \"One, two - hiiiiiiiiighYAH!\" And then he hears the hooker say, \"Oooooh...\" Again, \"One, two - hiiiiiiiiiiighYAH!\" And then the hooker says, \"Ooooooh...\" The next morning at breakfast, the shorter midget asks the taller one how his night went, and he says, \"Oh I had too much to drink and couldn't get it up. But it sounded like you had a wild time!\" And the shorter midget says, \"Wild time? I couldn't even get on the bed!\"",

Bob just replies 'oh, I know him from a few years back, I actually know a lot of important people.' His boss is sceptic, but Bob replies: 'Tell you what, name anyone you can think off, I bet you that they know me.' 'Fine,' says his boss, and he's determined to have Bob be embarressed, so he decides to put the bar high: 'President Obama.' 'Cool, no problem,' says Bob. A week later they're both standing outside the White House, and Obama comes out, spots Bob and goes, \"Bob? What are you doing here? Come in, bring your friend, lets have a drink together.\" Bobs boss has no clue how, but somehow Bob and the president are friends. Once they leave his boss goes 'Fine, you know the president, but I bet you don't know the pope'. Bob accepts the challenge, and the next week they're standing in Saint Peters square. 'This isn't gonna work, he's never going to see me here when theres this much people. You stay here, I'll go talk to him and you'll see me on the balcony, the guards know me too.' Half an hour later, Bob and the pope appear side by side on the balcony. Bobs boss gets a heart attack, and Bob goes to visit him in the hospital. 'What happened?

As the doctor was screaming in pain and yelling obscenities, Joe, watching, decided to help. He ran and grabbed his pair of barbecue tongs from his car and began grabbing the crabs and tossing them in a nearby trash can. The doctor was greatly pleased by this, and offered Joe a discount if he would help with the next surgery.

Her friend said, \"Well, the mystery is solved! Let's thank him for sharing!\" She took off her pretty blue hair ribbon and gently tied it around the Scotsman's endowment. A while later, the Scotsman was awakened by the call of nature. He raised his kilt and was bewildered at the sight of the neatly tied blue ribbon. He stared for a minute, then said, \"I don't know where y'been laddie... But it's nice ta see you won firrrst prrrize!\"",

After all, he could always climb back down, right? And so the man climbs so fast that he can barely hold on to the bars. His libido and wallet-sense are going crazy, and he can't wait to see what lies upon the next cloud! The woman of his dreams, sitting upon solid gold bars? A harem of women, each wearing skirts and dresses made of checks for a million dollars? He can't wait. And it is in this state of mind that he reaches the top of the ladder. He jumps up to the clouds, expecting his dreams, and is thunderstruck. All that he can see is a big, 6'8\"butch-looking biker man. He looks behind him to see that he hasn't been tricked or anything, and notices that the ladder is also gone!\" What the hell's going on! Who're you?! \"He shouts at the man, half in rage and half in disappointed libido.\" I'm Cess. \"",

To his horror he caught his son with his dick out jerking it like a madman. The farmer covered his face and walked away. His son came over a while later and the farmer said, \"Son, you really need to get laid. You're like 16. Here take our prize winning duck into town to see if you can trade a pretty lady for some sexing.\" The son agreed and took the duck into town. First, he asked some lady alongside the road if she would sex him up in exchange for his bird. She punched him in the mouth. This happened several times with bodily injury always being the result. Finally, the son staggered into a laudromat a few miles from home and saw a pretty lady doing some laundry. He asked, \"Excuse me miss, would be willing to have sex with me in exchange for this duck?\" The duck quacked. The woman was at first angry and about to punch him but realized that times were tough and that was one bitching looking bird. So she agreed and took him into the back room of the laundromat. The two of them proceeded to have sex and the now dazed son gave her the duck, per the prior agreement. When handed the duck, she hesitated and said, \"Hey, how about I trade you this duck back and we go have sex again?\" The son gasps and flails and takes his bird back and sprints with the woman to bump uglies for a second time. The woman is happy and sends the son home with her address and phone number. The dazed and foggy son takes his prized waterfowl directly out of the laundromat and is promptly run over by a truck. Luckily, he is ok but the duck is smashed and killed. The driver hops out and says, \"Gee, I sure am sorry. That seemed like a nice duck. Here is 50 cents to help you buy a new one.\" The boy happily accepts the money since it is a huge amount for that period and walks merrily home. Upon arriving the farmer sees his happy son in the setting dusk and asks him, \"Well son, how was your day?\" The son smiles enormously and says, \"Well dad, I gave a duck for a fuck.

He heads to the port's birdkeep, and finds the perfect talkative parrot perched on its swing within. The keeper discloses, however, that the bird was born with no legs, among another odd birth defect. Doubloon of course inquires, \"How he be a'holdin 'is ground?\" Smartly, the parrot replied, \"Awk! With me yardarm of course,\" to which the parrot opens his wings and reveals his other birth defect, his wraparound length tally-whacker. The captain is amazed at the impressive appendage, and of course considers the parrot perfect among his mangy and motley crew. Captain Loony Doubloon and the newly-monikered Tiltin Yardarm fast become talkative mates, and the captain wastes no time in warning his feathery friend of his cunning and lecherous first mate, Rusty Pegleg. \"A foul bosom's mate he is, he'll steal your wench from ye as soon as he'd steal the bung from its hole!\" They voyage on, and at the next port the crew finds a slew of horny wenches, of which the captain always gets the first pick. Doubloon immediately picks the sauciest wench of the bunch, taking well into account as Rusty Pegleg drools at the mere sight of her. The captain keeps his lady waiting in his quarters while he settles with the mistress of the brothel, betting his first mate wouldn't be brazen enough to plunder the Captain's choice pick with Tiltin Yardarm bearing witness. However, when the Captain returns, his wench is gone, and Yardarm begins to squawk a terrible account. Loony Doubloon is incensed, -\"What transpired 'ere, and where's me choice wench?!\" \"Awk! Rusty Pegleg is all to blame, I swear me Cap'n!\" This further infuriates Doubloon, -\"Tell yer every bit of it or I'll 'ave ye defeathered 'n tarred!\" Titltin musters his courage, -\"Awk! He burst through the door and thrust her to the bed!\" The captain now is boiling. \"And then what 'appened?!\" His parrot begins to quiver. \"Awk!

She was clawing for him to take her, begging him, pleading him 'Oh captain, Oh captain!'\" To this, the maddened Captain Loony Doubloon thrusts the tip of his blade to the edge of the poor parrot's neck, -\"Every bloody detail or yer to walk the plank and find Davey Jones locker with 'im!\" Tiltin Yardarm swallows heavily and replies, -\"I can't bear witness to what happened next.

Joe was charming enough to bring a lady home but they would always run away at the sight of his enormous manhood. So Joe began looking for surgery to shorten his long johnson. Almost every surgeon and doctor told him that there was no procedure to help him. But Joe didn't give up. After one doctor visit, as Joe was walking away in disappointment, the doctor called him back. \"I may actually know someone that may be able to help,\" the doctor said in a whisper. \"There is said to be a witch on that hill, there. Go to her, she should know what to do.\" So Joe, skeptical but still curious, went up to see her. She met him on her porch upon Joes arrival, and Joe explained to her his huge dilema. \"Well I have not potions or cures for such an ailment. Yet I know of a frog that that lives out on that pond, there. Go find that frog and ask it to marry you. Every time the frog says 'No' to your proposal your penis will shrink 10 inches.\" Once again Joe didn't know what to make of it all but figured he'll do anything to finally get laid. So Joe goes to the pond and begins searching for this magical frog. After quite some time Joe finally spots the frog, sleeping peacefully on a lilypad. \"Hey frog!\" Says Joe. The frog wakes up a bit startled. \"What is it man?\" The frog says. \"Frog, will you marry me?\" The frog, confused, says, \"No, I will not marry you, dude.\" Joe feels a tingle in his pants, looks down, and sure enough his penis was only 40 inches. Excitedly he asks again, \"Frog, will you marry me?\" The frog, annoyed, says, \"No, dude, I'm not going to marry you.\" Another tingle, another 10 inches gone. Joe, being reasonable, decides he will ask 1 more time, thinking 20 inches would be a doable penis. \"Frog!\" Joe says. \"What do you want, dude?\" Says the frog. \"Will you marry me, frog?\" The frog finally looses his cool and yells, \"No, no, and for the last time, no!\"",

The first day we had a great time going around las ramblas and going taking pictures at La Sagrada familia. That night we even attended a Barcelona game against Real Madrid. It was a great game, but unfortunately ended in a draw. We took a taxi back to the hotel, but on the way I started to feel funny. I had some pains in my chest and felt short of breath. I chalked it up to the long day I had just had, but I continued to feel worse. As we got out of the taxi and walked into the hotel, I collapsed. It became apparent to my wife and I that I was having a heart attack! I thought for sure I would die because the nearest hospital was 1/2 hour away. Suddenly from the back room came a woman wielding defibrillators. She shouted to the other staff to help and they ripped off my shirt and restarted my heart right there in the hotel! The ambulance arrived 20 minutes later, but thanks to this amazing woman my life had been saved. I spent the night in the hospital but I got out around noon the next day. I went back to the hotel to thank this woman. I said, \"I'm amazed that a hotel this small has a full time doctor as skilled as yourself!\" She replied, \"no one expects the Spanish inn physician.\"",

The brothers decided that this would be an ideal test case and agreed to each spend two months trying to cure the chicken. Hing immediately went back to the university. Having boned up on ornithology and traditional Chinese medicine, he decided that the answer was a prescription of gum-tree leaf tea. He gathered bushels of the tea leaves, brewed gallons of the tea, and poured it into the chicken for the two months. Meanwhile, Ming traveled all around China, praying at the shrines of his ancestors. One night he had a dream. His ancestors appeared and told him to feed the chicken tea made from gum-tree leaves! Ming, aware of his brother's lack of success, decided that the problem was quantity. He gathered whole CARTLOADS of leaves, and brewed BARRELS of the tea, and poured them into the chicken for the two months. At the end of the time, the poor chicken was still as naked as a bowling ball. Moral: All of Hing's courses, and all of Ming's kin; Couldn't make gum tea refeather a hen!",

Jim was a devout, aging Catholic, and he brought the five thousand in large bills, so as not to occupy much space in the coffin. He later told the members of his congregation, and oh how they lauded him on his selflessness to ease the mind of a dying friend. Michael was a converted Muslim, and he feared that the dead had no use for paper money, so he converted the five thousand into gold for his friend, leaving the ingots next to the bills. He felt a great warmth inside of him, a feeling that can only be brought about by a good, charitable deed. David was born Jewish, but wasn't so devout as many of his colleagues. He refused to buck off the stereotype and worked as a moneylender, a loan agent. Because of this, he understood how exchange rates worked and how trying to convert 3 different types of money to one may be hard for a man with little experience handling cash. Therefore, he wrote a check for fifteen thousand dollars, and took the gold and bills as change. He left his friend's side with such a great smile, he must have known the time he'd saved him in the afterlife.",

They sent me to areas where the enemies where and I was able to listen in on their plans without them questioning me because I am a dog. So I would report it back to the army and they there were always able to ambush the enemies without them knowing what hit them.\" \"Woah that's incredible.\" John says, \"How did you end up with this old man?\" Dog says, \"Well after 8 years of service, I figured it was time to hang up my boots and enjoy the rest of my life.\" Pleased with the dog, John goes back inside to find the old man to officially buy the dog. The old man asks, \"So how did you like him?\" John replies, \"He's amazing. Being a talking dog and all that stuff about working undercover for the army is just incredible. I'd love to buy him, but first I must ask, why are you giving him away so cheaply?\" \"Eh, that dog's a liar, he never left the yard.\"",

The teacher was being very honest and told her the truth about her son and how disastrous his performance is at school. The mother could not bear the truth, and decided to change school for her son; She even moved to a new city. Years later the teacher has a cardio attack and the local doctors referred her to the only doctor who could perform the surgery. Leaving with no choice, the teacher's family take her to the doctor. The doctor performed a long operation and it was successful. When the teacher woke up, she saw the face of the doctor and smiled. She wanted to say thanks, but could not since she was still under the affect of anaesthasia. Instead tears rolled down her eyes and her faced started to turn blue! She tried to raise her hand to point at something, but in vain she failed to do so and died. Unprepared for this situation, the doctor was looking around trying to find the cause of death. He was looking around until he saw our friend John, who works as a janitor at the hospital. John had plugged out the ventilator machine to plug in his vacuum cleaner.

His fault the bird had learned those words. So he opened he freezer door and to his surprise the Parrot gently fluttered out and landed on the mans shoulder.

That's strange.\" Just then he feels a tap on his shoulder. He lowers the rifle and looks behind him. He gasps in fear as he sees the bear standing over him. \"What do we have here?\" Says the bear. \"Looks like a free lunch.\" \"Oh please don't eat me says John. I will do anything.\" \"Well...\" The bear says, \"There is one thing. You have to let me fuck you in the ass. Then I will let you go.\" \"Um... Ok. Just don't eat me.\" Says John. The bear fucks him and lets him leave. John is so angry that the next day he goes back to the gun shop and tells them he needs a bigger gun and that he is going to get that damn bear. \"Give me that 7mm rifle!\" John buys the rifle and the next day goes to the ridge. Scanning with the binos he sees the bear again! \"Got you now!\" He whispers to himself. He shoulders the rifle, looks the scope, and the bear is gone again. \"What the hell?\" He thinks. Just then a tap on his shoulder startled him. He turns around in shock to see the bear there standing over him again. \"Back again I see.\" Says the bear. \"What will it be this time? Do I eat you or fuck you?\" \"Fuck me,\" John grumbles under his breathe. So the bear fucks him again and lets him go. The next day he is so furious that he returns to the gun shop again. \"I want the biggest weapon you have here!\" John screams at the salesman. \"I'm gonna get that fucking bear!\" \"Ok, well, its not really legal but we have this RPG in the back. Be careful though because we only have one rocket,\" says the clerk. The next day, John returns to the ridge determined to kill the bear. He looks through the binos for the bear, locating him near some trees. \"This time you are mine!\" John whispers to himself. He grabs the RPG, aims into the valley, but no bear. Again he feels a tap on his shoulder. Hanging his head, John turns around to see the bear there again smiling at him. The bear says, \"You ain't here for the hunting are you boy...\"",

'Dear Brother, 1 - Next time, only have a few sips and don't down that drink at once. 2 - We don't put ice cubes and lime into the mass chalice. 3 - The Bible is not a coaster. 4 - The tablecloth on the altar is not a napkin. 5 - There are ten commandments, and not twelve. 6 - There were twelve disciples, and not ten. 7 - We don't refer to the cross as, \"that bigass T.\" 8- We don't refer to Jesus and his disciples as, \"DJ JC and the Gang.\" 9- David beat Goliath with a sling, he didn't, \"destroy that fucker's ass with a Magnum 357.\" 10- It was the snake that was slithering on the apple tree, and not, \"God's dick.\" 11- We don't refer to Judas as, \"that dickhead.\" 12- The Pope is holy, he isn't, \"our mate,\" and we don't call him, \"the Godfather.\" 13- We don't refer to, \"the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit,\" as, \"the Big Daddy, the Lil' Dude and the Crypt Fugitive.\" 14- Judas betrayed Jesus for thirty silver coins at the Mount of Olives, and not for, \"two cents at the Chinese market.\" And besides, sinners go to hell, and don't, \"piss off to party with our boy Satan.\" .'",

The Jews understandibly got really angry about this, so the Pope proclaimed that if a Jew could manage to beat him in a theological debate, they could stay. The Jews chose their wisest rabbi for the religious debate against the Pope. To make it more interesting, the rabbi proposed to make speaking forbidden for the duration of the debate. The Pope accepted. On the big day, the Pope and the rabbi sat down at a table and the followers of both religions gathered around them. First, the Pope raised three fingers. Then the rabbi raised one finger. Next, the Pope drew a circle in the air while the rabbi pointed to the ground. Then, the Pope took out the bread and the wine. The rabbi answered by taking out an apple. The Pope, amazed, stood up from the table. 'I give up' he said. 'You're too wise for me, rabbi. You and your fellow Jews can stay.' Later, the cardinals asked the Pope what he talked about with the rabbi. 'First, I raised three fingers to remind him of the Holy Trinity. But he raised one finger to remind me there's only one God in both our religions. After that, I drew a circle in the air to show him God was everywhere around us. But he pointed to the ground to show that God is right here with us. Then I took out the sacramental bread and wine to show him God absolves us from our sins. However, he took out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He had an answer to everything, what could I possibly do?!' At the same time, the Jews asked the same question from the rabbi. 'First, the Pope showed me we had three days to leave the city. But I made him understand that not even ONE Jew would leave. After that, he showed me around to say he'd cleanse the whole city from Jews. But I pointed to the ground, showing him that we'd stay right here.' 'And then?' Asked the Jews. The rabbi shrugged. 'I don't know. He took out his lunch, and so did I.'",

One of the boys turned to him, \"You don't know what the purple wombat is?\" Jimmy was about to answer, \"no,\" but it was time to leave the bus and go to his first class. In this class he again heard some kids talking about the purple wombat and again asked them what it meant. \"Jimmy, would you please come up here for a second.\" The teacher said. Jimmy went up. \"Don't you know not to talk in class?\" The teacher asked. \"Yes,\" said Jimmy, \"but I was just asking about the purple wombat.\" With that the teacher scolded him and sent him to the principal's office. In there the principal asked him what was the cause of him being sent there. \"I just asked about the purple wombat!\" Jimmy exclaimed. \"That's it young man, you're going home right now!\" Yelled the principal. At home his mother was furious and demanded to know the reasons for Jimmy being sent home. \"All I did was ask about the purple wombat.\" Jimmy sobbed. \"Go to your room right now!\" Ordered his mother. Jimmy went to his room and stayed there for the rest of the day. At around midnight he heard a strange sound coming from outside his window. It was a voice. Jimmy opened his window to hear it better. \"Jiiimmmmmmmyyyy, I am the purple wombat, come to the island on the lake tomorow night.\" Said the strange yet soothing voice. Jimmy was so excited, he would finally know what all the fuss was about. The next night, Jimmy got his canoe out of the shed and brought it down to the lake next to his house. He rowed out on the water and headed toward the small island. When he was close enough, he saw the purple wombat on the shore.

Whilst the husband and wife get dressed, the butler tells them he's heading into town to pick up something for the ball. The husband and wife are a little displeased that he left it until so late, but decide that as long as he's back before the party, it should be fine. Once the man is finished changing into a tuxedo, and his wife into a evening gown, they notice that the butler still hasn't come back yet. They begin to worry, as the ball is in one hour. They try their best to prepare without him, but they are fairly clueless about what to do. Soon, guests start arriving, but the husband and wife are too embarrassed to answer the door, for fear of being seen as slobs by their guests. Ten minutes later, the butler bursts through the front door with a small package in his hand, and rushes off into the kitchen, apologising to the husband as he passes him. Furious, the couple march into the kitchen to find that the butler has emptied a pack of chewing gum into a frying pan. \"What on earth are you doing you imbecile?\" Cries the husband. \"Why sir, it's a tradition! Fried gums before a ball.\"",

You'd better check.\" With that the father headed upstairs to Johnny's room. \"What's going on Johnny?\" Johnny obviously excited said, \"Dad, remember that hot cheerleader I told you about? Well I am having dinner at her parents house and then we're going to the movies!\" Dad said, \"That's great Johnny! But you know, we've never really discussed the, er birds and the bees thing..\" Johnny interrupted, \"Dad we had this discussion in 9th grade science class. I know ALL about it!\" ... \"Well Johnny, you know that we're a deeply religious family and don't believe in premarital sex, but I also know how the world is, so even though I DO NOT condone it, please be sure you have a condom... And DON'T tell your mom I said this. Just be very careful son.\" Johnny said, \"Jeez dad, I'm not stupid,\" and with that told his dad he had to get showered and leave because dinner was in an hour! On the way to his date's house, Johnny heeded his father's advice and went into the local drugstore. He went to the back counter where they kept the condoms and asked the pharmacist, \"Excuse me sir, do you have any profolactics?\" The old man looked at him and said, \"how old are you boy?\" To which Johnny replied, \"17 sir.\" The pharmacist muttered under his breath, \"what is the world coming to these days...\" What kind do you want boy?\"...\" I don't care sir, just a strong one\". The man flicked a pack on the counter. Johnny snatched the pack and rushed to this front register to pay. Glad to be on his way, Johnny quick! Y walked the half dozen blocks to his date's home, excited about the evening's prospects. Johnny rang the doorbell. His soon-to-be date's mother answered the door and said,\" You must be Johnny! Suzy has been talking about you all afternoon come in! We'll be having dinner soon and Suzy will be down in a few minutes, feel free to watch TV, \"and with what she disappeared into the kitchen. Johnny now was starting to feel a little nervous, wondering when Suzy would appear. Several minutes pass and finally the girl of his dreams is standing in front of him.\" Hi Johnny! Sorry I made you wait so long, I had trouble figuring out what to wear, \"As if on cue, Suzy's mom said,\" I know you guys have a movie to catch so let's go to the dining room so you can eat and get out of here. Suzy's father and mother entered the dining room. The father giving Johnny a stern looking review. Johnny was now obviously nervous. His date squeezed his hand and whispered, \"don't let him bother you, he must have had a bad day.\" As they seated, the mother said, \"Johnny, we're a deeply religious family and we always give thanks for our meals by saying grace.\" Johnny said, \"Can I say the grace?\" Suzy looked surprised, then a bit proud as Johnny began to pray. Johnny started praying in a very low and indiscernible pattern. Mumbling and unintelligible, nearly under his breath. Mother looked at father thru one open eye, then at her daughter as Johnny continued to go on and on and on, when finally, Suzy leaned over and whispered to Johnny, \"I didn't know you were religious?\" ... Johnny whispered in return, \"I didn't know your dad was a pharmacist!\"",

That handsaw you are using will be left in the dust when you start using this.\" The man replies: \"Vell, I guess it vouldn't hurt, but I fink my handsaw vould be better in za long run.\" The businessman is not deterred. \"Sir, I promise you that this saw will revolutionize the way you cut logs. Feel free to try it out for a day, and if you really don't like it, I'll leave you be.\" So, the man takes the chainsaw, and the businessman leaves him to test it out. The next morning, when the businessman comes back, the man tells him that it didn't work. \"This saw is garbage! My saw could do vay better than dis piece of junk, it takes nearly five times as long!\" The business man is surprised. \"Well, I guess maybe this one could have a defect. Please, try this one instead.\" The man gives him a new chainsaw, and goes on his way, hoping to sell more in the middle of town. Later that night, the businessman comes back to check up on the man's progress. \"Dis vun is trash as vell!\" He says. \"The entire thing is vorthless!\" Astounded, the businessman takes it back. \"Well,\" he says, \"I'll start it up, and see what's wrong with it.\" He fills it with gasoline, and pulls the cord, and saws through a nearby log with apparent ease.

He barks at them, \"dirty fascists, I'll skin you three and use your hides to make a coat for the Russian winter. But I don't want to get my hands dirty. I'll let you each go out on your own terms.\" The Italian is the first to go. He approaches a nearby tree and, with all the honor he can muster, tries to hang himself with his belt. However, he grossly underestimated its strength. Twisting, shouting, and asking the German for help, he eventually ends up hanging upside down, his face bloody and, although he put in the effort, he just didn't get the desired results. As ordered, Russians begin to skin him and move on to the next prisoner. Next was the German. He produces a pistol from his belt and, full of pomp and circumstance, goosesteps behind the tree line. The Ruskis wait for the gunshot and are rewarded. But when they check behind the tree line to retrieve the body, they find none. They shrug, thinking that there's no way he could possibly have run off to some place warmer. But with one less skin and winter approaching, they move on to next prisoner. Last is the Japanese. Stoic to the end, he gets on his knees and draws his sword. Plunging it into his gut and twisting it every which way, he never even flinches. Rather, he looks the Red Army officer straight in the eye and says, \"fuck your coat.\"",

They don't have very much money, but they have a scrawny little dairy cow that gets them through the hard times. One day the farmer goes out to milk the cow, but when he gets to the barn, he finds the cow facedown and dead. He knows right then that it's all over, and he grabs the shotgun off the wall and shoots himself in the head. His wife hears the gunshot and runs out to see what's happened. She finds the cow and her husband dead and she gives up on life. She grabs the shotgun and shoots herself in the head as well. The eldest son comes home from work and finds his parents dead. He goes to use the shotgun, but it's out of ammo. Instead, he runs to the ocean to drown himself. But before he can do that, a mermaid comes out of the water. \"Wait!\" The mermaid shouts. \"I know what happened to you and your family, and it's terrible! But I can make it all better! I have magic, but it's based on sex! If you can make love to me fifteen times in a row without stopping, I can bring back your mother, your father, and the cow. But if you fail, it will kill you.\" He isn't sure he can do it, but he decides to try. He makes it five times before he gives out and he just can't do it. He can't go on anymore, and he dies. The next oldest brother gets home and finds the corpses. He too tries to use the shotgun, finds its out of ammo, and runs to the ocean. The mermaid pops up and makes him the same deal -- but this time, it's 20 times, to save his brother too. He does his best, but he only makes it three times before he can't go on anymore. He, too dies from the magic. The third brother gets home, and he finds his parents and the cow in the barn and his brothers by the ocean. The mermaid pops up and says, \"wait, wait, wait! I know it's a long shot, but I can grant you your wish if you can just make love to me 25 times in a row without stopping!\" The third brother says, \"I dunno if that's a good idea. I mean, look at what I did to the cow!\"",

Upon hearing that the priest has a few hours off the fisherman invites him out to sea to fish with him. Out at sea it doesn't take long for the fisherman to realize that the priest has no idea how to fish, so he gives him some quick instruction and shows him how to cast his bait out into the water. Within moments the priest manages to reel in the largest fish that the fisherman has ever seen. In the moment of excitement the fisherman exclaims, \"Look at the size of that Son-of-a-bitch!\" Immediately the priest becomes disturbed and says, \"My son, please don't use such language.\" The fisherman, embarrassed and hoping word of this gaffe will not reach the rest of his family, makes up an explanation in a moment of ingenuity, \"Oh no father, that's the name of that type of fish, a son-of-a-bitch.\" He lies, taking advantage of the priests fishing naivete. The priest is pacified, and begs forgiveness for jumping to conclusions. The fisherman, relieved, brings the priest back to the docks and drops him off. The priest lumbers back to the church, with the giant fish in his arms. Upon entering the church he sees the bishop and approaches him, \"Bishop, look at the size of this son-of-a-bitch I caught!\" The bishop stands wide-eyed a moment, \"Priest, how could a man as holy as you use such language in the house of God?\" The priest calmly explains that it is the name of the fish, and the bishop feeling embarrassed for jumping to conclusions offers to take and clean the fish for the priest. After cleaning the fish the bishop takes it to the maid in the kitchen and tells her, \"Maid, I want you to cook this son-of-a-bitch for me.\" The maid blushes and responds, \"Bishop, it may not be my place to say so, but is such language fitting for a man of your stature?\" The bishop laughs haughtily, explains that it's the name of the fish and that he too had made the same mistake only minutes earlier. The maid laughs too, apologizes and cooks the fish. It just so happens that the Pope decided to stop in for dinner at their church that evening. They are all sitting at the table when the pope says, \"Oh, my children, I know that gluttony is a sin but I simply can't stop myself from eating this fish. I must know, where did you get it?\" \"I caught the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the priest. \"I cleaned the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the bishop. \"And I cooked the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the maid. For a moment the pope sat silently, staring at them all wide-eyed.

The operation is a success and six months later the patient comes in for his follow up. Patient: \"Doctor, the operation was a success. I have not stuttered since the operation. I have a great new job and my self esteem is fantastic. However, there is one problem My wife says that she sort of misses the great sex we used to have before the extra six inches were removed.

After paying $500,000, he takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light. While waiting for the light to change, an frail looking old man on a yellow moped pulls up next to him. The old man looks over at the Ferrari and asks, \"What kind of car ya' got there, Sonny?\" The young man replies, \"A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!\" \"Wheeewee... That's a lot of money,\" says the old man as he tucks his thumbs up against his suspenders. \"Why does it cost so much?\" \"Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!\" States the banker proudly. The moped driver asks, \"Mind if I take a look inside?\" \"No problem,\" replies the proud new owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around at all the bells and whistles lining the dashboard. Sitting back on his moped, the old man whistles and says, \"That's a pretty nice car, all right... But I'll stick with my moped!\" Just then the light changes, so the banker decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph! Suddenly, he notices a yellow dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be, and suddenly... Whoooooosssshhhhh! Something blows by him, going much faster! \"What in the hell could be going faster than my Ferrari?\" The young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 250 mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 275 mph. Whoooooosssshhhhh! He's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again! Dumbfounded, the banker floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again! The Ferrari red lines and there's nothing more he can do! Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end. The young man stops and jumps out, and unbelievably, the old man is still alive. He runs up to the mangled old man and says, \"Oh my God! Is there anything I can do for you?\" The old man whispers with his dying breath... \"Unhook... My... Suspenders... From... Your...

He buys a suitable young'un from the rooster emporium and turns him loose in the barnyard. The old rooster sees it strutting around and gets a little worried. \"So they're tryna replace me, eh?\" The old rooster thinks. \"I'll show them!\" It walks up to the new bird and says, \"so you think you're the new stud in town? I bet you really think you're hot stuff don't you? Well, I'm not ready for the chopping block yet. I'll bet I'm still the better bird, and to prove it, I challenge you to race around that hen house over there. We'll run around it ten times and whoever finishes first gets to have all the hens for himself.\" Confident in his ability to outpace the old cock, the young roosters remarks, \"Hah! You're on, and since I'm so great you can even have a half a lap headstart and I'll still win easy!\" So the two roosters head over to the hen house to start the race with all the hens gathering to watch. The race begins and all the hens start cheering the old rooster on. After the first lap, he's still maintaining his lead. However, with each lap the old rooster lets it slip a little as the new guy catches up. It's the seventh lap and each rooster is frantically sprinting, with the old rooster just barely leading. By now, the farmer has heard all the commotion. He grabs his gun and runs into the barnyard, figuring a fox or something is after his chickens. When he gets there, he sees the two roosters running around the hen house with the old one still lightly in the lead as they near the last lap. The farmer takes aim with his shotgun and blows the young rooster to smithereens. Walking away in bewilderment, he mutters to himself, \"damn, that's the third, gay rooster I've bought this month!\"",

He looks around and sees lots of dildos, sex dolls, vibrators and etc, but nothing that would keep his wife occupied for 3 weeks. So he asks the clerk, who happens to be the store owner, and though at first the clerk says there is nothing there that would keep a person satisfied for that long, after some badgering, he finally pulls a black ebony box with a gold clasp from underneath the counter -- all the while assuring the newlywed that it's not for sale, being a family heirloom and of priceless sentimental value. He opens the box, and inside is an apparently normal dildo. The newlywed guy is unimpressed, but the clerk interrupts. \"Let me demonstrate,\" he says. He looks at the box and says, \"Voodoo Dick -- The Door!\" And the voodoo dick jumps into the air, floats over to the door, and starts going at the keyhole like crazy, pounding away until the door begins to crack down the center. Finally, the clerk says, \"Voodoo Dick -- The Box!\" And the voodoo dick flies back into the box. With some difficulty, the guy convinces the clerk to sell it to him. When he arrives home, he gives his wife the box and says, \"Just open it and say, 'voodoo dick, my pussy' if you ever get horny, all right?\" So he leaves on his business trip, and by the third day, the wife is getting pretty horny. So she opens the box and says, \"Voodoo dick, my pussy,\" thinking the whole thing rather rediculous. After about 15 minutes, she has had several orgasms and is starting to get tired, so she tries to pull the voodoo dick out. Apparently, her husband had forgotten to tell her how to turn it off. So she puts on a dress and starts driving to the hospital. About half way there, the voodoo dick is pumping away at her, and she starts multiple orgasming, and so she swerves a bit over the yellow line. A police officer happens to be behind her, and pulls her over. As the cop stands at the window, she is sweating and her face is blushed, and she's squirming all over as the voodoo dick goes at her. The cop looks at her for a second and says, \"Lady, how many drinks have you had tonight?\" She says quickly, \"Officer, I swear I haven't had anything to drink! There's this voodoo dick going at my pussy and I can't make it stop! I'm on the way to the hospital to have it removed!\" The officer thinks about it for a second, gives her a smirk and says, \"Voodoo Dick my ass, lady.\"",

Being curious, one guy said to the other, \"I wonder how deep it is?\" So he picks up a small rock and drops it down the hole. They both listen for the rock to hit bottom, but they don't hear anything. So the other guy picks up a larger rock and drops it into the hole. Again they listen, but hear nothing. \"That's a pretty deep hole!\" Said the second guy. After a few more rocks were thrown in with no sound, the first guy says to the other guy, \"Hey, help me throw this old tree trunk in there. That'll make some noise for sure!\" So the men throw the huge log into the hole. As they're waiting for a sound a goat suddenly busts through the treeline running as fast as it can towards the hole! When the goat reaches the hole, it jumps up in the air and goes straight down into the hole. As the two men were standing there in shock as to what just happened, a farmer walked into the clearing. The farmer asked the guys, \"What are you two doing out here?\" The men explained the whole thing that just happened with the goat. The farmer scratches his head and said, \"Hmmm, yep that is pretty unusual. Well no worries, I know that it wasn't my goat. You see, I keep my goat tied up to a huge log.\"",

Finally, he makes his way to the bar and sits down. \"Whats all that about?\" Asks the barkeep, \"Oh, I'm a professional wagerer,\" he replies, further explaining that he has a number of various stupid human tricks he can do, and is pretty adept at accomplishing things suggested by others, for bets. \"Really?\" Says the barkeep. \"Bet you 5 bucks you can't throw this cherry into a lowball glass from 10 feet.\" \"You're on,\" says the wagerer. They shake, he grabs a cherry and a lowball glass, and sinks the shot his first attempt. \"I wanna warn you,\" he says, pocketing the 5spot the bartender slapped on the counter, \"I am VERY coordinated.\" \"Okay,\" says the barkeep, looking down at a regular sitting on the other side of the bar, a woman he knew to be as butch as they come, and not afraid to punch a man. \"Bet you 50 bucks you can't get her phone number.\" The professional wagerer glances down at her, looks back at the barkeep, and says \"... 20 bucks, I'm a little skeptical of my odds with a woman with a shaved head.\" \"Deal,\" says the bartender, watching the wagerer walk over, engage in polite conversation with her for awhile. He watches him do a couple stupid bar tricks, pull a card from behind her ear, and put the charm on hard. He was over there for a good 10 minutes before the wagerer threw up his hands and eventually made his way back to his seat. \"Well, you've got me. I couldn't get her number, here's your 20,\" he said, slapping it on the table. Smiling, the bartender pocketed the cash, and went to fill an order. \"Wait, I have a wager for you,\" said the man, grinning ear to ear. \"I bet you $300.\" ... He said, counting out crisp twenties and laying them across the bar, \"that I can piss exactly 1 shot into 3 shot glasses, while standing on this barstool, while being slowly spun around, without splashing a drop.\" He held his finger to his chin, in thought, and quickly added, \"Blindfolded.\" The bartender looked carefully at the money, and thought it over. Surely there was no way that was possible, he thought, and after deliberation, replied, \"You've got yourself a deal.\" \"Okay,\" said the wagerer. \"I'm gonna need you to help me though. Stand to the side of me here, while I hop on the chair, and spin me around while I piss, okay?\" The bartender quickly set three shot glasses on the counter, and walked to the other side of the bar, while the wagerer wrapped a handkerchief around his eyes, grabbed his cock in his left hand, held out his right hand to stabilize himself, and told the bartender to spin him. He took a few seconds to stabilize himself, as he spun, and loudly declared, \"HERE I GO!\" He started pissing, and his bladder was clearly full. He started pissing on the floor, then the chair, then the bar, then the chairs, then across the face of the bartender, then again on the chairs. Piss was flying everywhere except for perhaps three or four drops that landed in the shot glasses. After he finished, and shook his cock dry, he lifted one side of the hankie from his eye and said, \"Well fuck, guess I lost that one.\" Grinning ear to ear, and wiping the piss from himself, the bartender started laughing, uproariously, at the idiotic bet the wagerer made. He walked over to the counter to collect his money, smiling, and turned to see something he didn't expect. The butch girl from the other side of the bar was walking over, slapped the wagerer, and started counting out hundreds from her rhinestone wallet, slapping them unceremoniously into the hands of the betting man. \"What's got you so worked up, Liz?\" The bartender asked her, still counting out his money. \"This fucker put the moves on me for a little while before I told him we bat for the same team, then he made a bet with me for a grand that he could, within half an hour, piss all over your face and bar and get you to laugh about it!\"",

May I PLEASE S'IL VOUS PLAIT stick my fingair in your belly-bouton?\" The girl finally gives up and goes, \"All right, fine! We'll go to the bathroom in the back and we'll get it over with.\" When they're in the bathroom, the Frenchman tells the pretty girl to close her eyes when he does it. She closes her eyes. Then she feels something she didn't expect. She opens her eyes suddenly and gasps and goes, \"OH! That's not my belly-bouton!\" And the Frenchman says, \"Oui oui, that's not my fingair!\"",

            "joke": "Dan liked children. It had always a problem for him, but he kept it to himself, and, until his wife left, he suppressed all feelings about it. After Linda cheated on him with his best friend and abandoned their marriage, Dan was depressed. He spent a couple weeks without seeing anyone, only leaving to get food and other necessities. Dan had a generous boss and took advantage of his numerous vacation days. Eventually, some friends got a hold of him and got him out of the house. All attempts to cheer him up were futile. Strippers and the like had no effect. One day, a family moved in across the street from his two story suburban home. They had a thirteen year old daughter, and, in the pits of Dan's depression, his old desires awakened. He would watch her from his bedroom window, but never fathomed fulfilling his fantasies. A couple weeks passed before Dan's wife sent him divorce papers from Europe, where she was staying with Chad, Dan's old friend and the Best Man at their wedding. Dan's agony recommenced, and he moved on from only Emily who lived across the street to watching girls coming out of the school, a few blocks over. When steel prices skyrocketed, the automotive industry was hit hard. Dan got laid off. This threw him to rock bottom. He had been gradually coming to terms with his pedophilia and, though a favor from a former coworker, bought a snow-colored van. Dan began driving out to neighborhoods where he wouldn't be recognized and luring girls to climb to his vehicle. He had always been particularly attractive. Despite the weight he had gained since his divorce, convincing young teens to come with him was surprisingly easy. He didn't dare force them to have sex. Touching and groping sufficed for him. However, Dan wasn't very discrete and was apprehended by the police in a matter of weeks. Dan pled guilty, and the judge assigned him a 7 year sentence for his crimes. In jail, he contemplated suicide multiple times, but never had the courage to go through with it. The only thing that moderated his depression was the art classes he chose to take. Dan was surprisingly talented, and the judge who convicted him bought one of his paintings as evidence of the positive effects of the prison system. When he got out, Dan registered as a sex offender, and moved out of state. He had trouble getting a job and was turned down 6 different times because of his history before finding a position at Subway. To keep his spirits up, Dan decided to try to get a girlfriend. He made an online dating profile, but no relationships lasted after they found him on the registry. The longest one he had lasted a month. As a result of pure coincidence, Susan ended it with him on the same day that the Subway franchise Dan that was working at closed down. Dan relapsed into depression, and his pedophilia reignited. He slipped back into the same routine that put him behind bars. Dan found a cheap Chevy Astro in white, and this time he took it further. Unfortunately for him, emotional distress made him sloppier. The police caught him even sooner. Dan found himself in court once again. By pure chance, he was confronted with the same judge from before. The judge's wife had found a better job, which happened to be in the same state Dan took up residence in. Her husband moved with her, knowing that he could find a similar position in any city. When Dan stepped into his courtroom, the judge was surprised. He had bought Dan's impressionist painting, and recognized the man he had convicted.

The orientation staff woman starts off the meeting with a roll-call: \"Do we have Mr. Johnson present?\" \"Here,\" says a man. \"Mr. Smith?\" \"Present,\" responds another man. \"What about Mr. Wong?\" The Chinese man replies, \"Here,\" just as another Chinese man raises his hand says, \"Here,\" as well. \"Oh my,\" says the orientation staff person, looking at her sheet. \"It appears there has been a mix-up. We only have one Mr. Wong penciled in for today. I saw the duplicate name and entered you both in the system as the same person. My mistake! Let's see here... Why don't you both stop by Room 666-b tomorrow morning at 9:00 and we'll see if we can straighten this out.\" The next morning, the Chinese man shows up to Room 666-b, and notices the sign above the door: \"REINCARNATION SERVICES.\" He walks in and is immediately greeted by a man in a nice business suit. \"Good morning, Mr. Wong! I am the Director of Reincarnation Services. Please step into my office. Your associate, Mr. Wong, has already arrived.\" He walks into the office and has a seat. The Director likewise sits down behind his desk and explains, \"We are very sorry for the paperwork mix-up yesterday, gentlemen. Unfortunately, it's going to take about a week to get it all straightened out in our system. You know how it goes. But, in the meantime we'd like to make it up to you here at Reincarnation Services!\" In this department, we are responsible for sending souls back up to Earth to haunt the living once again. We do zombies, wraiths, liches, you name it! Usually we reserve these services for some of our more senior Hell residents, but seeing as these are special circumstances, I think we can make an exception. Let's see here... I think we can pencil you in for this Halloween, we can have you come back as a wight to haunt a small town for a week. How does that sound?\"\" Both of us? As one wight? \"The Chinese man asks.\" Yes, remember you are still in the system as a single person until we figure it out. But we'll send you up top for a week, you'll have the time of your afterlife, and by the time you get back we'll have it all sorted out.\"\" Well, yeah, that sounds pretty great, \"says the Chinese man.\" Good! Now let me just place a phone call and set up the details. \"And the Director picks up the phone and dials a number.\" Yes... Hello, I have two gentlemen here I'd like to send up as a wight this Halloween... Yes, those two... Yes... Uh huh... What do you mean you can't? You won't make an exception?... Alright, I see... Alright, yes, goodbye. \"The Director hangs up and says to the two Chinese men,\" I'm very sorry sirs, but it appears we can't do that.\"\" Well why not? \"They reply.\" It's company policy.

One day, they decide they want to get married, so Johnny goes to Susie's father to ask him for her hand. Johnny bravely walks up to him and says, 'my Smith, me and Susie are in love and I want to ask you for her hand in marriage.' Thinking that this was the cutest thing, Mr Smith replies, 'Well Johnny, you are only 10. Where will you two live?' Without even taking a moment to think about it, Johnny replies, 'Susie's room. It's bigger than mine and we can both fit in there nicely.' Still thinking that this is adorable, Mr Smith says with a huge grin, 'Okay then, how will you live? You're not old enough to get a job. You'll need to support Susie.' Again, Johnny instantly replies. 'Our allowence... Susie gets $5 a week and I get $10 a week. That's about $60 a month and that should do us just fine.' By this time, Mr Smith is a little shocked that Johnny has put so much thought into this. So, he thinks for a moment, trying to come up with something Johnny won't have an answer to. After a moment, Mr Smith says, 'Well Johnny, you seem to have it all figured out. I just have one more question for you. What will you do if you have little ones of your own?' Johnny just shrugs his shoulders and says, 'Well, we've been lucky so far.'",

Bullwinkle, the town's leading citizen, had been smashed flatter than a kippered herring by a falling safe. \"It's a common enough means of death for cartoon characters,\" Fenwick opined. \"Every year, we lose five or six citizens to falling safes. But this time, it was no accident. This time, it's murder!\" He showed Feghoot the ingenious deadfall trap rigged to rain financial ruin on an unsuspecting victim. Bullwinkle's antlers were still entangled in the tripwire. Grasped tightly in one hand was a small statue of a Hindu god. The dead quadruped's best friend, Rocky the flying squirrel had been with Bullwinkle at the time of his death, but when questioned by Feghoot, the distraught rodent said all he could remember was seeing a rabbi fleeing the scene upon a pogo stick. Fenwick immediately issued an APB for the rabbi. \"You're wasting your time, Fenwick,\" said Feghoot grimly, as he stood from his examination of the body. \"The rabbi has been framed. When you find him, he will tell you of some elaborate ruse that induced him to be on a pogo stick at this time and place.\" \"How do you know that, Feghoot?\" Asked the Inspector. \"This is the work of the Christmas Killer,\" Feghoot declared. \"I have been on the trail of this fiend for years, and I fear that we might never catch him. Every December, he arranges one of these grisly messages.\" \"Look! Didn't you notice the smile on the victim's face? The corners of his mouth have been propped up... By these!\" He displayed two toothpicks he had taken from Bullwinkle's mouth. \"I still don't see how you know the murderer is the Christmas Killer,\" said Fenwick. \"Isn't it obvious?\" Feghoot asked. \"Wee Vishnu, a merry crushed moose, and a hoppy Jew near.\"",

He looked at the pig and said, \"Yeah I fancy the pig, I could fuck the pig!\" However when he approaches the pig the dog jumps in his way snarling and snapping at him, blocking him from getting close to the pig. \"Damn it,\" says the man and he retreats to his shelter, his lust defeated. Life goes on as normal for a while, he climbs trees, breaks cocunuts and swims in the sea. Then a few weeks later the man gets the horn again. He looks at the dog, \"nah I don't fancy the dog,\" he says. He looks at the pig and, \"Yeah, I fancy the pig, I could do the pig!\" He tries again to fuck the pig. But again the dog jumps to the pigs defense, snarling and biting, not letting the man near the pig. \"Fuck it, bloody dog,\" says the man and retires to his shelter, his lust defeated. He goes on for a few weeks much as before living the simple life, he creates fire, improves his shelter and smashes rocks for fun. Then once again comes the unstoppable urge. The man looks at the dog, \"Nah I don't fancy the dog,\" he says. He looks at the pig, \"yes I fancy the pig, I could do the pig,\" he says, and once again he tries to fuck the pig. However again the dog jumps to the defense of the pig, gnashing and snarling and the man is beaten and returns to his shelter his lust defeated. A few days later he's walking along the beach when to his surprise he discovers the body of a young woman. He pulls her out of the sea and carries her to his shelter. She's unconscious at first but he feeds her and gives her water and after a week she is nursed back to health. \"You know you really helped me,\" says the woman. \"Really?\" Said the man. \"Yes, without you I would have died on that beach,\" she said. \"So infact I owe you my life.\" Then... Suggestively touching her swimsuit she says, \"You've been stuck on this island a time right? It must get lonely here? Is there any thing I can do for you?\" \"Well,\" says the man after some consideration. \"There is one thing... Can you take the dog for a walk!\"",

At the cowboy's hearing the judge the judge asked the cowboy, \"Why did you suddenly become enraged for no apparent reason and shoot this individual dead.\" \"Well, the cowboy explained, I tried to be friendly and he began calling me names and insulting me for no reason and finally I got mad.\" \"What names did he call you that made you so mad that you wanted to kill him?\" Asked the Judge. \"Well, answered the cowboy, three times I bought him a drink, and each time he grinned in my face and called me Grassy Ass...\"",

Third time is the charm!\" Hits his staff on the ground and bellows out, \"let my people go!\" And the water parted! It only lasted a moment. Jesus started clapping and gave Moses a pat on the back once he say back down. Moses looked sheepishly to Jesus and said, \"remember the time you walked on water? That was so amazing and would love to see it. Would you mind?\" And Jesus smiled, \"of course I wouldn't!\" Jesus wanders to the waters edge and walks out into the water, sinking.

Ron was not the easiest guy to talk to, but I was curious as to why he would be fishing alone on his honeymoon. So I said, \"Hi Ron. Surprised to see you out here today.

The rancher only wanted to be paid the fair value of the bull. The case was scheduled to be tried before the justice of the peace in the back room of the general store. The attorney for the railroad immediately cornered the rancher and tried to get him to settle out of court. The lawyer did his best selling job, and finally the rancher agreed to take half of what he was asking. After the rancher had signed the release and took the check, the young lawyer couldn't resist gloating a little over his success, telling the rancher, \"You know, I hate to tell you this, old man, but I put one over on you in there. I couldn't have won the case. The engineer was asleep and the fireman was in the caboose when the train went through your ranch that morning. I didn't have one witness to put on the stand. I bluffed you!\" The old rancher replied, \"Well, I'll tell you, young feller, I was a little worried about winning that case myself, because that durned bull came home this morning.\"",

Luckily, we are on good terms so I am the only person who knows the password, 0451 if you want to know. Sometimes he changes it like for the New Years he sets it as the year, or Christmas time when he changes it to the date, but it's late fall right now so there he has it set as the regular code. Although once he decided to be a little generous, he got a new heating system for the office, it's a little screwy sometimes, you turn the heat on but it never actually turns on. But the heaters came with new thermostats, these show the date and the time on them. There are only three other guys in the office, Tim, he's just a weird one, he asks about what kind of stamps we buy, I don't like him much. Then there is some gay guy. I can't remember his name, he's not exactly a vibrant person, he blends in to the office like he is part of it. Lastly there is an old guy, he's been in the office for decades now, I think he might just be dead and no one ever checked, I have never seen that man leave his office chair. Right now, we are all working overtime, I think I might have forgotten to go home last night, I can't remember. There was a big crisis back at HQ and now we are stuck with the paperwork. I really don't know what day it is. Suddenly that old guy yells over, \"Turn up the heat!\" I don't blame him, it's freezing, must be that new heating. After he sees me get up he decides to go be unproductive somewhere else by taunting the other guys. I walk over to the thermostat, I figure I should see what time it is, since I don't remember sleeping. It's nine o'clock on a Saturday. The regular code, I punch it right in. There's an old man standing next to me, making fun of Tim and that gay.",

So, he thinks for a moment trying to come up with something that Johnny won't have an answer to. After a second, Mr. Smith says, \"Well Johnny, it seems like you have got everything all figured out. I just have one more question for you. What will you do if the two of you should have little ones of your own?\" Johnny just shrugs his shoulders and says, \"Well, we've been lucky so far...\"",

Water?\" The bartender gives him his cup of water and the little alley sips away happily. Then, your typical 2-way street walks in, sees the little alleyway in the only chair and politely asks him to move. \"Mr. Alley, you seem to be in my seat, could you please find somewhere else to drink your beverage?\" The little alley squeaks, \"Oh I'm so sorry Mr. Two-way street, I didn't ummm realize I was in your chair. Here you go.\" The little alley downs his water and scampers out of the bar. The two-way street orders some Pepsi and sits down to read his morning paper. Suddenly, a mean old 2-lane highway storms in, and yells, \"Out of my seat ya weenie.\" The street replied, \"Sir, I'm trying to enjoy my refreshment and read the morni...\" WHAM! The highway smacks the street on the head and the street decides he's going to be a pacifist today, \"I mean of course, it's your seat, my apologies.\" \"Gimme some beer, not that pussy ass girly cola.\" The bartender pulls out the finest Miller Light he can find and passes it to the highway. All was peaceful until around 4PM when Interstate 95 runs in during rush hour, \"MOVE OUT OF THE WAY BITCH I'M IN A HURRY.\" \"FUGGIN MAKE EM YA BASTARD,\" and the two hammer away at each other. The two go at it for a few minutes, but the highway could not keep up with the fury of hundreds of short-tempered drivers that had just been cut off. The interstate grabs the highway, \"GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY ASS,\" and tosses him where the 2-way street was nursing his headwound. The interstate claims victory, finishes his beer and says, \"QUICK BARTENDER, GIMME SOME VODKA.\" The interstate begins to down vodka by the handle. Halfway through the 3rd handle of vodka, the Autobahn walks in, \"Out of my way, you puny little piece of asphalt.\" The Autobahn grabs his gun and puts 6 rounds into the interstate. He sits down and tells the bartender, \"I want the blood of my enemies mixed with your hardest rum on the rocks, shaken, not stirred.\" The bartender squeezes out some of the interstate's blood from an open gunshot wound and uses the bullets for ice. He mixes it with rum and serves it to the autobahn. But before the autobahn can pick up his drink, a little dirt bike trail walks in. The autobahn says, \"Ha, I suppose you're gonna make me move out of my chair?\" The trail starts screaming and grabs the autobahn by his head and rips him limb from limb. With a guttural cry of victory the little bike trail runs out. At this point, the highway has recovered sufficiently to ask the street, \"Gee what's his problem?\" The street replies, \"Oh him? He's a cycle path.\"",

I point them out to the owner, and ask him why they're up playing so late. The owner explains that these two rock climberswanted to buy the same rock climbling-themed board game from the store, and they had both gotten into a heated argument over who got to buy it. Not wanting an all-out fist fight on a crowded night, he had them play a, \"best of nine,\" tournament of the board game, and the winner would earn the right to buy the set. I nodded sagely.

Donald then gathers up the cabinet and asks them the question. Nobody knows the answer, and after many failed attempts somone speaks up and says, \"I know! Lets ask Colin Powell! He's a smart man, he should know.\" So they call up Colin Powell. They ask him, \"Colin, we have an important question for you...

However, he adds, there is an experimental treatment. The man quickly assures the doctor that he will try anything. The doctor tells him the operation must coincide with the death of a baby elephant. The doctor explains that the musculature of an infant elephants trunk is very similar to that of a penis and that research shows a transplant may be possible. So the man returns home to await the call that they have a trunk on ice. Several months pass and the man is miserable. He tells the doctor his confidence is gone, he never goes out, he's missing too much work and drinking too much. The doctor consoles him as best he can until finally the day comes. The man awakes after surgery to see the surgeons smiling face. The operation was a success. After months of difficult physical therapy the man has regained his confidence. To celebrate he asks a woman to accompany him to a fine restaurant. They meet in the bar and all is going well over drinks and small talk. They proceed to their table and the waiter comes to take their order. Before he leaves for the kitchen he places a basket of dinner rolls on the table. Suddenly the man's penis bursts through his zipper, flops onto the table, grabs a dinner roll and disappears back into his trousers. The woman is flabbergasted and says, \"that was amazing! Can you do it again? The man replies,\" probably, but I don't think I can fit another dinner roll up my arse. \"",

The Coach looked a little skeptical, but not wanting to discriminate, he agreed. The no-armed man dived into the pool and began to kick his legs furiously, motoring down the length of the pool at a tremendous rate, and records the quickest time of the day. The Coach is impressed, and makes no delay in adding the armless man to his team. Coincidentally, the very next man has arms, but is missing his legs. The Coach is nervous about letting such a physically challenged man into his trial, but reluctantly agreed. The no-legged man drags himself into the pool and proceeds to spin his arms so fast, he looked a blur, completing the trial even faster than the armless man. With a huge smile on his face, the Coach adds the legless man to the team, when he hears a voice behind him. \"Oy! Wot bout me mate?\" The Coach spins around, yet sees no-one, looking down, he is surprised to see a man who is just a head, staring back up at him. \"Carn Bruv!\" Exclaimed the head, \"Drop us in the pool, I'll blitz all these uvver wankers!\" After the previous two participants, the Coach is excited to see what what amazing time the head will be able to record. He picks up the head, drops him in the pool, and the head promptly sinks to the bottom. The Coach waits patiently, yet the head doesn't move. A minute later... The head hasn't moved, a small stream of bubbles float up to the surface. After another minute, the Coach has become worried, grabs a pool scoop and retrieves the head to the edge of the pool. Coughing and spluttering, the head recovers quickly. \"What happened?!\" Asked the Coach, \"Can't you swim?\" With a look of indignation, the head glared up at him and exclaimed, \"I pulled a muscle!\"",

And he sees it, a dirty old spittoon sitting under the bar, glistening in the evening light. \"Hey Kevin,\" he proclaims, \"I dare you to drink the contents of that spittoon there.\" Kevin, not looking to be called a wuss quickly accepts and struts over to the spittoon. He grabs it and has to peel if off the floor, leaving a spot that hasn't seen sunlight for years. He takes a quick whiff to see what he's getting into and dry heaves. But he quickly pulls himself together, cleans some dried spit off the rim with his sleeve, puts his lips to the rim and tilts his head back. At this point the smell hits the whole saloon, just straight purification, clearing most of the clientele out, covering their mouths and seeking fresh air. Joe begins gulping down the contents, heaving and convulsing after every swallow, letting excess run down his chin and chest. Down his front is just this rotten, pussy, brown and black swirled slime, with chunks of chew and butts falling and splatting on the floor. After a minute of this his friend eyes watering and mouth dropped open comes to with a fresh whiff of rancid eggs. He heaves and cries, \"Kevin, stop, that's enough, you win! I can't stand it anymore, you have to stop.\" At this point, Kevin tips his head back farther and starts drinking more, letting more pussy sludge run around the edge of the spittoon. His friend seeing this looses it and runs outside to vomit. Five minutes later Kevin comes outside, green in face, empty spittoon in hand, and completely soiled with rotten mucus and spittle. Everyone in town is crowded around the entrance to the saloon curious about what was happening, covering their mouths trying to protect themselves from the disease the man is radiating. His friend slowly stands up, cleaning the vomit from his mouth and asks, \"Why didn't you stop? I said you won.\" Kevin looks his friend square in the eyes and flatly responds, \"It was all one piece.\"",

I guess this is where he works.\" Estelle nods, a little confused, but ok. They go inside and go up to the bartender... A very attractive brunette girl. \"Hey Murray! Can I make you your usual? Gin and Tonic?\" \"Murray,\" says Estelle, now a little more urgently, \"how does the bartender know you?\" \"Oh, that's just Renee.. She bartends at the bowling alley - I guess she moonlights here too.\" \"Ok,\" says Estelle.. Getting a bit more rattled. They find a seat, and a stripper comes right up to Murray and starts grinding him. \"Hey Muuuuurray... You want your usual dance tonight baby?\" At this, Estelle has had enough, and storms out the front door, with Murray chasing after her. She hails one of the taxis parked out front, and he jumps in after her. Murray can't get a word in edgewise. After giving the driver directions, Estelle lays into him. Cursing at him. Yelling at him. Calling him every name in the book. This goes on for about 5 solid minutes, until Estelle, exhausted from the explosion, stops altogether. There's finally a moment of silence in the cab. \"Hey Murray,\" says the cab driver, \"this girl you got tonight is a real bitch.\"",

You know, multi-colored hair, tats and piercings, and dresses like it's constantly at a rave. The only thing in the world a Trid gives a damn about is having fun. That's it. If it's not fun, a Trid simply isn't interested. Well, one day a Trid happens to be walking through the forest, trying to figure out something fun to do. He was bored, and boredom is worse than hard labor to a Trid. As he's walking along, he spots a rabbit a little ways ahead of him. \"Hmm, it might be fun to chase that rabbit.\" The little Trid thought to himself, so he took off running towards the rabbit. The rabbit takes one look at the Trid running towards him, and bolts away at top speed. The Trid starts laughing and pours on the speed, trying as hard as he can to catch up to the rabbit. \"Oh, what fun!\" The little Trid exclaimed, as he dashed after the rabbit around trees, and over rocks. Suddenly the rabbit hooked a mad turn and started up a tall hill, running like the wind. At the top of this hill, a goblin happened to be dozing in the warm sunshine. The rabbit was moving so fast, he ran over the goblin without even seeing him. Waking up startled, the goblin looks down the hill to see the Trid coming at him at full steam. So, he waits until the Trid reaches the top of the hill... And he kicks him! Down the hill the Trid went rolling and bouncing, head over heels, to land in a heap at the bottom. Picking himself up, he squeals with delight. Being kicked down the hill was the most fun he had ever had, and he went running back up the hill, where the goblin once again kicked him back down. Over a dozen times the Trid ran up the hill, and over a dozen times he was kicked back down, each time being more fun than the last. He was getting ready to run up again, when a sudden thought occurred to him; This would be even more fun with more Trids! So he high-tailed it back to Trid village to let everyone know about the hill and the goblin. Soon, there were dozens of Trids at the hill. They would run up one side of the hill, and the goblin would kick them down the other side. Meanwhile, the rabbit that the first Trid had been chasing was wondering what had happened to his playmate. He had been enjoying the chase as much as the Trid had, and he went to see what had happened. He came back to the hill and saw the line of Trids and the goblin kicking them. Shrugging he shoulders, he got in line and followed the Trids up the side of the hill. When he got to the top however, the goblin just stood there staring at him. \"What's wrong?\" The rabbit asked, \"Why won't you kick me down the hill?\" The goblin shook his head and said, \"Silly rabbit, kicks are for Trids!\"",

In fact, they would probably give more money to him just out of spite.\" The beggar with the Star of David listened to the Pope, smiled, and turned to the beggar with the Cross and said, \"Jignessbhai, look who's trying to teach the Patel brothers about bijness!\"",

He didn't really feel like shopping anymore, so he put his jeans back on and walked out in his sock feet. He informed mall security and they escorted him to the control booth so he would look at the surveillance cameras to try to spot the guilty canine. The mall security looked and looked at footage while Roy had some coffee someone had offered him out of pity. Well, finally, the security guard thought he saw the culprit on screen in another part of the mall. He motioned to the hapless victim and lamely said, \"Pardon me, Roy, is that the dog that ate your new shoes?\"",

When I got back to the apartement she was lying naked in bed like she had just been having sex. So I checked under the bed and there was no one there. I checked in the closet and there was no one there, so I looked on the balcony and there was some guy hanging from the railing. I got so angry I beat his hands until he fell, then I ran back in the apartement, grabbed the refrigerator, brought it back out, and dropped over the railing right on top of him. Then I was so mad I had a heart attack and died and came here.\" St. Peter said, \"It sounds like you've had it rough, so I'll let you in.\" The next man walks up and gets asked the same question. So this man says, \"I was in my apartement when I slipped and fell over the railing. I was able to grab onto the railing of the apartement below me but then this guy starts pounding on my fists until I fall. Then he goes and dumps this refrigerator on me and I wound up here.\" St. Peter lets this guy in too because he has also had it rough. Then the third guy comes up and is also asked the question. This guy replies, \"Okay, so I'm banging this married chick when the husband comes home early. So I go and hide in the refrigerator...\"",

Nearest service station is over 50 miles away, fortunately for them, there is a house farm nearby. They get to the door and knock. An old, bitter looking old man answers the door with a rifle hanging down his right arm. He looks at them and asks, \"What you boys want?\" They tell him their car broke down, and need to use the phone. He responds with, \"Ain't no help comin' 'round this time'a night. Y'all could spend the night and help will be here by the mornin'\" They look at each other and agree to stay. \"Course there is one stipulation. You see that girl over there?\" Asks the old man with his rifle aimed at the girls direction. The guys look over with wide eyes and jaws dropped at the direction of a hot, young, blonde girl wearing a crop top plaid shirt, and daisy dukes, standing by the kitchens enterance. \"That's my promiscuous daughter. You boys gotta agree you ain't gon' try to do anything with her, or I will shoot your dicks off!\" Exclaimed the old man with his rifle now pointing at their dicks. \"I'm gonna cover my daughters pussy with glitter, and check y'alls dicks in the mornin' to make sure y'all stayed true to y'alls word.\" The old man said. They nod their head in agreement and walk into the house. The daughter prepares a small meal for the guys and goes off to her room. The old man then shows the three guys over to their room and reminds them of their agreement. He closes the door to their room and walks next door to his daughters room with a bag of glitter and gives her a good night kiss before heading to his room. A couple hours pass in the night. The white guy gets up to use the bathroom. He comes back 30 minutes later. 1 5 minutes later, the brown guys gets up to use the bathroom. He returns an hour later. 30 minutes go by, and the black guy gets up to use the bathroom. He is gone for over 2 hours before returning to bed. Morning comes and the old man walks in the room with his rifle, and wakes the guys up. \"Alright boys, get up and line up!\" The guys get up, and oblige to his command. He points his rifle at the white guy, and says, \"Drop them pants, boy!\" The white guy drops his pants and reveals a glittered dick. BOOM! The old man shoots him in the dick, and the white guy runs out the house, screaming in pain. He cocks his gun and points it at the brown guy. \"Let's see your dick, boy!\" The brown guy, nervous and shaking, drops his pants to reveal a glittered covered dick. BOOM! The old man blasts the brown guy right in the dick, and he goes running out the door, crying in pain. He points at the black guy and tells him, \"Your turn!\" With a big grin on his face. The black guy, sweating and trembling, drops his pants. To the old mans surprise, there was no glitter on his dick. \"Well, I'll be damned! You're one of the good men that stays true to his word! Good job, boy, I'm proud of ya!\" The black guy wipes sweat from his forehead, says thank you to the old man, and smiles at him with a mouthful of glitter.",

She prays devoutly every night before going to sleep, and one day an angel appears in her dreams and instructs her to go to the next town over, and seek the midget who lives there. \"Once you find him propose marriage to him. He will say no, and each time he does, you will instantly grow 3 inches.\" The girl, skeptical but still more desperate, seeked the midget the next day. Indeed there he was, short, stout and with a mean grimace smeared like peanut butter from jaw to jaw, and once the girl asked for his hand in marriage he yelped a defiant, \"No!\" And marched off in a huff. And wouldn't you know it, the girl had, indeed, grown three inches. Ecstatic from the results, she revisited the midget the next day, and the next, each time boldly rejected with a simply, \"No!\" But growing another six inches for her trouble. Now standing at a proud 5 foot 9, the girl pondered whether she should make one last visit. Her height was now certainly more than adequate, but what she truly longed was to have a grand physique, to be statuesque. So the girl, in high spirits, made one last trek across town to the grouchy midget. \"Kind sir, would you please accept my proposal of marriage?\" To which the midget, flush red in the face, exclaimed: \"No, you stupid cunt, no! How many times do I have to tell you, no! No No No No No! NOOOOOO!\"",

The matter was a serious one because the members of the staff of the zoo, while expert at caring for animals, had had no experience whatever in rounding them up or capturing them. The zoo director appealed to the office of the mayor for help and the secretary to the mayor asked, \"Have you looked in the yellow pages?\" The director said he hadn't, but would, immediately. To his surprise, under, \"animal capturing service,\" he found a listing for the Acme Ape Apprehenders. He called them immediately Within 20 minutes a panel truck arrived at the admin office of the zoo and a small man emerged and rushed to the director who was waiting at the door. \"Is there a wooded area in the vicinity?\" The little man asked. The director said there was, within one half mile from the zoo. \"Hop in the truck,\" the little man said. The director did and they drove off. Minutes later they arrived at a small grove and immediately spotted Arnold on a branch about 25 feet above the ground. The two men got out, went to the back of the truck and the little man opened the door. An excited little dog jumped out and began running around in circles. The little man reached into the truck and took out a suicase which he opened. In the suitcase were a pair of handcuffs, which he handed to the zoo director, a sawed off shotgun, which he leaned against the trunk of the tree, and a baseball bat. \"Now,\" the little man said, \"I'm going up into the tree with the baseball bat, and I'm going to knock the ape out of the tree. The instant the ape hits the ground the dog, well trained, will grab the ape by the crotch. The ape, instantly and instinctively will grab at his crotch with both hands. And you snap the handcuffs on and we've got him. The zoo director, pointing to the shotgun leaning against the tree, said.\" I'm not too sure about this, what's the gun for? \"The little man said,\" Look, I'm an expert. I know what I'm doing and things will go just fine, after all, I have the baseball bat. I know my job and it'll never happen but if the ape should, by any chance, knock ME out of the tree,.",

He goes to one house where the bin hasn't been left out. In the spirit of kindness and after having a quick look about for the bin, he gets out of his truck, goes to the front door and knocks. There's no answer. Being a conscientious bloke, he knocks again - much harder. Eventually, a Japanese man comes to the door. \"Harro!\" Says the Japanese man. \"G'day mate, where's ya' bin?\" Asks the collector. \"I bin on toilet,\" explains the Japanese bloke, a bit perplexed. Realising the fellow had misunderstood him, the bin man smiles and tries again. \"No mate, where's ya' dust bin?\" \"I dust been to toilet, I toll you!' Says the Japanese man, still perplexed.\" Listen, \"says the garbage collector.\" You're misunderstanding me. I mean, where's ya' wheelie bin?'\"\" OK, OK. \"Replies the Japanese man with a sheepish grin, and whispers in the collector's ear.\" I wheelie bin havin sex wiffa wife's sista! \"",

The driver's door opens, and a redneck shambles out, looking clearly drunk. He stumbles his way over to the patrol car, opens the back door, and gets in. The cop runs to his patrol car, opens the back door, and throws the redneck out to the ground. \"What the hell do you think you're doing?! You can't get in my car like that!\" Said the cop The redneck picks himself up off the ground and says, \"Shit, officer. I'm turning myself in. There's no way in hell I can pass that drunk test.\"",

He is taken to a clearing with 3 identical huts. The chief says, \"In the first hut is 6 bottles of the finest Russian vodka, drink them all in an hour. After that, in the second hut, there is a lion that has not eaten for days because he has a bad toothache. You need to remove the tooth using only your hands and you only have an hour.

To everyone's amazement an empty bottle of vodka is tossed out every 10 minutes. An hour goes by and the pilot stumbles out of the hut completely drunk. After a couple of tries he eventually makes it into the second hut. Almost instantly the lion starts roaring and the pilot starts screaming. This goes on for about a half hour then it goes silent. A few minutes later the pilot stumbles out, claw marks all overn and clothes just covered in blood.

The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany... Within seconds, he receives an email on his Android that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Macbook Air, after a few minutes, receives a response. Finally, he simply opens the spreadsheet on his laptop, turns to the cowboy and says, \"You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.\" \"That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,\" says Bud. He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car.

Maximilian Steel was a space-criminal, one of the biggest scumbags in Andromeda-9 since the arrest of the notorious gangster Forty-Eyes. Steel was known for holding up large transportation shuttles and demanding ransom. It was no surprise that after years of dodging the Intergalactic Police Force, Steel managed to develop a hefty amount of money. On July 4,3055, Steel revealed a massive construct the size of the Moon, on it was a weapon with great concentrated power that could destroy a planet. The weapon was pointed at the capital of the Milky Way galaxy -- Earth-6, a behemoth, terraformed Jupiter, the center of governance and knowledge in the galaxy. Steel broadcasted to this massive planet, and demanded 300 trillion quarsecs or else the entire planet would be decimated. Helpless to do anything, the planet gave into Steel's demands and decided to give him all the money. Steel, being the scum that he was, fired his massive weapon anyways. The massive weapon was a beam of pure concentrated plutonium, with a power to destroy the planet in 30 minutes. The planet's military was in a panic, scrambling fighter ships and sending them in the hopes of destroying the weapon before it could do more damage. One fighter by the name of Jet had the idea of making the plutonium beam impact another object in space before reaching Earth-6. He thought of sending his fuel-cells in the line of the weapon, burning the plutonium in process and causing an explosion in space. Jet shot up into space, with the plutonium mass approaching him at a high speed. Jet threw his fuel-cells at the plutonium, but it's far too much power for the cells to handle... Jet's fuel can't melt Steel's beam.",

She seems to be enjoying herself and he doesn't mind the bit of work so he starts working another finger in. She is getting a bit more aggressive and is clearly having a good time so what the hell he works his other two in leaving his thumb to work her clit. Well the girl is having a blast and is beginning to moan a bit. She starts asking for more. The guy is not all that drunk and kinda intrigued he figures, \"what the hell let's see where I can take this.\" He starts to work his other hand up beside the first one a few minutes goes by and he has everything but his thumbs in this girl and she is getting really loud now. She's moaning away grabbing her tits and yelling more! More. So the guy pulls back a bit on his hands and works his thumbs in. After a few more minutes he's wrist deep and beginning to get concerned. What the hell is going on here? Who is this girl and how was I ever going to satisfy her anyways? Meanwhile she has her heals on the couch and is trusting herself up and down screaming more, more! So he starts pushing away on his hands and he gets to his elbows. He is deeply concerned about being swallowed whole and is no longer comfortable with the situation and yet completely enraptured by the idea of how far this can possible go. So he keeps pushing away when all of the sudden he pots up to his shoulders. Clearly this chick is hollow. She must be built like a pylon. He is reminded of Russian doll figurers who are completely hollow and have another person inside of them. He has a quick thought about how this little 5'6 lady must have a vortex to a different dimension in her that is feeding her excitement at the cost of his limbs. Meanwhile she's just in utter ecstasy she is yelling away and completely oblivious to everything around her when all of the sudden she stops cold. She looks him right in the eyes and says want to see something awesome? Try to clap. The guy is up to his shoulders inside this girl. He can't move let alone clap.

When asked what he'd like for his last meal, he replied simply with, \"A banana, if you will.\" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. The conductor ate the banana in regular fashion and braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen. However, after the electricity was activated, nothing happened to the conductor. The prison guard was shocked and, not knowing what to do, simply let him go unscathed. In a few days, the conductor was back to work. A few days after his return to the train business, he managed to derail yet another train, again killing nearly a hundred people but surviving the crash. As before, he was trialed and found guilty of mass murder. Again, he was sentenced to death by electric chair. It was the same prison guard as before. He was surprised to see the conductor again but held his tongue, for the man was about to die and it would be rude to question him. \"What would you like for your last meal, sir?\" The conductor respond as he did last time: \"A banana, if you will.\" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. The conductor ate the banana in regular fashion and braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen. The electricity was activated and the conductor was prepared. But, as before, the conductor was unhurt. The prison guard checked for any malfunctions but found nothing, not believing the entire situation was possible. In shock as before and not knowing what to do, the guard let the conductor go. The conductor was, against all odds, alive and was still allowed to continue his job as a train conductor even though he was responsible for the death of almost two hundred people. He was thankful to be allowed to continue his job but also scared. He would try not carefully from now on. However, this idea didn't help much as on the first train he was conducting after the chair, he managed to somehow crash yet another train. He was the only survivor of the train, which contained over a hundred people. He was trialed and, again, found guilty of the murder of over a hundred people. He was sentenced to death by electric chair. The prison guard was the same, the surprise was the same, the procedure was the same. After giving the banana to the conductor, the guard was silent. He couldn't bring himself to say anything, all he could do was prepare the chair. The man sat in the chair, expecting death. The guard activated it and, again, the conductor was unscathed. The prison guard couldn't contain himself. He simply had to ask, \"Sir, how did you manage to crash a train 3 times? And how did you survive the chair 3 times? Did the banana have something to do with it?\" The conductor responds with: \"No, I suppose I'm just not a good conductor.\"",

Looking around at the women occupying it, he decides he has a shot. Hours go by, being shot down by all he tried he returns to the bar. Bartender walks over and asks him what he will have, to which he responds he can't afford any. Asking, \"Damn it man, I've never been to a bar I couldn't manage a free drink out of a women.\" Bartender begins to laugh and explains the bar is pretty much all married ladies and there blue collar plant working husbands. Bartender: I tell you what buddy, if you can make our mascot that donkey over there laugh, I'll let you drink the entire night for free. The man looks over when a moment of inspiration hits him, what's the worst that happens the donkey doesn't laugh? The man walks over and simply whispers in the donkey's ear. As the bartender watches in amazement the donkey rolls over seemingly, \"ahh eee ahhing,\" to death. The man walks back over and tells the bartender, \"I'll take a knobb creak and a budweiser. Keep em coming.\" The bartender being a man of his word pays his debt, and the gentleman drinks the night away on the house. The following night the gentleman returns, and asks the bartender if the bet still stands. Bartender: I'll make the bet with ya, but this time make him cry. I don't mean calling and acting an ass, I mean legitimately crying. Gentleman: You've got yourself a bet. The gentleman walks off towards the mascot, with more confidence then should be allowed for such a silly bet. He stands in front of the donkey, back to the bar, fumbling in his pockets seemingly. The bartender concerned he is digging for a weapon runs over to stop the man. By the time he arrives the donkey has laid himself down, tears welling from its eyes and looking as if he had lost the will to live. Gentleman: I guess I won the bet again. Bartender: So it seems you did. Both walk back to the bar, the bartender more then confused how Dr. Doolittle here has managed these feats. Bartender: I'm a man of my word, but I'm honestly not gonna pay up this time unless you answer a couple questions. Gentleman: Sure, you've been more then a good sport. Bartender: How in the fuck did you make that donkey laugh? Gentleman: Well, it was easy. I walked up, took a quick study of the donkey, and whispered in his ear, \"Mines bigger.\" The bartender now laughing himself, asks, \"Ok, well how in the hell did you make him cry?\" Gentleman: Now that was even easier.

However, their manager got the dates wrong and the group ended up doing a three-day run in an outdoor theater in Albuquerque in the middle of the July heat. The event was exhausting and by the third night, everyone was just hoping to survive one more concert and move on. During the last song - Beethoven's Ninth - the bass players in the back of the orchestra hatch a plan. There's a bit in the middle of the song that's all violins and flutes, surely they won't be missed. They decide to sneak out to the bar next door for a drink, 'just to keep hydrated.' They stay a little longer than they should have, and drink a lot more than they would have, when one of them realizes that they are going to miss their entrance. The ring-leader of the group tells them to not worry, as he had the foresight to tie the last page of the score down with a bit of string. It will take the conductor a while to unite it, which means the concert will stop and they can sneak in. They drunkingly congratulate him for being so smart as they stumble back to the theater. Meanwhile, the conductor is in a bind. The very energetic end of the piece is coming up and his bass section is missing. The violinists are working up a sweat trying to keep up in the heat when suddenly the first violinist faints from heat exhaustion. This is the last straw for the second violinist and she faints too. The bass section begins stumbling in not so subtly as they are knocking people, instruments, and chairs over. To top it all off, someone has tied down the last page of the score as he is desperately trying to flip the page. It would do us good to sympathize with the conductor and put ourselves in his shoes. From his vantage point, he begins to realize that: There are two out, at the end of the ninth The score is tied And the basses are loaded.",

The man asks the woman why she's so down and she replies, \"My husband left me because he said I was too kinky in bed.\" \"What a conicidence,\" he said. \"My wife just left me. She said I was too kinky in bed too.\" They start talking and after a few more drinks they decide to go to the woman's apartment for some kinky sex. When they arrive at her apartment she tells him she needs a few minutes so she can slip into something more uncomfortable. She comes out of the bathroom with a tight black leather outfit, holding a whip and handcuffs. Then she hurries into the kitchen and comes out with tabasco sauce, whipped cream and a rolling pin. She notices that the man is putting on his coat and is walking towards the door to leave. \"What's going on?\" She asks. \"I thought you wanted to get kinky?\" He turns around and says, \"I just fucked your dog and shat in your purse. I'm all done.\"",

The lion's team received. They were able to get two first downs and then had to punt. The mule punted and the rhino was back deep for the kick. He caught the ball, lowered his head and charged. First, he crushed a roadrunner, then two rabbits. He gored a wildebeast, knocked over two cows, and broke through to daylight, scoring six. Unfortunately, they lacked a placekicker, and the score remained 6 - 0. Late in the first half the lion's team scored a touchdown and the mule kicked the extra point. The lion's team led at halftime 7 - 6. In the locker room, the lion gave a peptalk. \"Look you guys. We can win this game. We've got the lead and they only have one real threat. We've got to keep the ball away from the rhino, he's a killer. Mule, when you kick off be sure to keep it away from the rhino.\" The second half began. Just as the mule was about to kick off, the rhino's team changed formation and the ball went directly to the rhino. Once again, the rhino lowered his head and was off running. First, he stomped two gazelles. He skewered a zebra, and bulldozed an elephant out of the way. It looked like he was home free. Suddenly at the twenty yard line, he dropped over dead. There were no other animals in sight anywhere near him. The lion went over to see what had happened. Right next to the dead rhino he saw a small centipede. \"Did you do this?\" He asked the centipede. \"Yeah, I did.\" The centipede replied.

As he travels in the past, he saw Isaac newton and gave him the piece of paper, \"sorry I don't know what it implies,\" said Newton, with great disappointment on his face, he travels again and saw Albert Einstein, \"sorry gentleman, but this equation is impossible.\" He goes back again in the past and met other several men of mathematics, but no to avail. Admitting his defeat, he went to a local bar sobbing and distraught. The bartender asks, \"Ben what's the problem?\" \"No one can help me.\" Ben replied. \"You know, Ben, my mother in mexico always tells me not to give up, don't give up Ben, you can tell me your problem.\" Ben immediately grab the piece of paper and ask, \"can you solve it?\" As he reads the equation the bartender laughs.",

When the camera zooms in, we see that he crucifies Jesus Christ onto Eiffel Tower. He turns to the camera and says, \"Wilson Nails! Very effective!

Now the fly noticed that if it moved about three inches down the leaf it would catch some mist off the pond, and cool down a bit. Now in the pond there was a Fish, and the fish noticed that if the fly moved down about three inches, it would be able to jump up out of the water and eat the fly. Now next to the pond behind a tree there was a Bear, and the bear noticed that if the fly moved down about three inches, the fish would jump out of the water to get the fly and the bear could come out from behind the tree and catch the fish for dinner. Now across from the pond eating a cheese sandwich was a Hunter, and the hunter noticed that if the fly moved down about three inches, the fish would jump out of the water to get the fly and the bear would come out from behind the tree to catch the fish and the hunter could drop his cheese sandwich and shoot the bear. Now in a log next to the hunter was a mouse, and the mouse noticed that if the fly moved down about three inches, the fish would jump out of the water to get the fly and the bear would come out from behind the tree to catch the fish and the hunter would drop his cheese sandwich to shoot the bear and the mouse could come out of his log to get the cheese sandwich. Now behind the log there was a Cat, and the cat noticed that if the fly moved down about three inches, the fish would jump out of the water to get the fly and the bear would come out from behind the tree to catch the fish and the hunter would drop his cheese sandwich to shoot the bear and the mouse would come out of its log to eat the cheese sandwich and the cat could jump out from behind the log to get the mouse. SO, sure enough, the Fly moves down about three inches, the Fish jumpes out of the water, the Bear comes out from behind the tree, the Hunter droppes his sandwich, the Mouse comes out of the log, the Cat jumpes over the log to get the Mouse and misses and falls in the pond.

Guido signs back, \"I don't know what you are talking about.\" The lawyer tells the Godfather, \"he says he doesn't know what you are talking about.\" The Godfather than pulls out his pistol, puts it to Guido's head and says, \"Ask him again!\" The lawyer signs to Guido, \"He'll kill you if you don't tell him.\" Guido signs back, \"OK! You win! The money is in a brown breifcase buried behind the shed at my cousin's house.\" The Godfather asks the lawyer, \"What did he say?\" The lawyer responds, \"He said you don't have the balls to pull the trigger.\"",

He's never lost a match because of this 'pretzel' hold he has. It ties you up in knots. Whatever you do, do not let him get you in that hold!

A sigh of disappointment arose from the crowd and the trainer buried his face in his hands, for he knew all was lost. He couldn't watch the inevitable happen. Suddenly, there was a Long, High Pitched Scream, then a cheer from the crowd and the trainer raised his eyes just in time to watch the Russian go flying up in the air. His back hit the mat with a thud and the Irishman collapsed on top of him, making the pin and winning the match. The trainer was astounded. When he finally got his wrestler alone, he asked, \"How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!\" The wrestler answered, \"Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of testicles right in front of my face. I had nothing to lose so with my last ounce of strength, I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could.\" The trainer exclaimed, \"Oh, so that's what finished him off?!\" \"Not really.

Demographics tell us what you like, dislike, whom you vote for, what you buy, and what you watch on TV. Well, the Corporate Zodiac goes a step further: Simply by your job title, people will have you all figured out... MARKETING: You are ambitious yet stupid. You chose a marketing degree to avoid having to study in college, concentrating instead on drinking and socializing, which is pretty much what your job responsibilities are now. Least compatible with Sales. SALES: Laziest of all signs, often referred to as, \"marketing without a degree,\" you are also self-centered and paranoid. Unless someone calls you and begs you to take their money, you like to avoid contact with, \"customers,\" so you can, \"concentrate on the big picture.\" You seek admiration for your golf game throughout your life. TECHNOLOGY: Unable to control anything in your personal life, you are instead content to completely control everything that happens at your workplace. Often even YOU don't understand what you are saying, but who the hell can tell?! It is written that the geeks shall inherit the Earth. ENGINEERING: One of only two signs that actually studied in school, it is said that ninety percent of all personal ads are placed by engineers. You can be happy with yourself: Your office is typically full of all the latest, \"ergodynamic,\" gadgets. However, we all know what is really causing your, \"carpal tunnel.\" ... ACCOUNTING: The only other sign that studied in school, you are mostly immune from office politics. You are the most feared person in the organization; Combined with your extreme organizational traits, the majority of rumors concerning you say that you are completely insane. HUMAN RESOURCES: Ironically, given your access to confidential information, you tend to be the biggest gossip within the organization. Possibly the only other person that does less work than marketing, you are unable to return any calls today because you have to get a haircut, have lunch, and mail a letter! MIDDLE MANAGEMENT/DEPARTMENT MANAGEMENT, /\"TEAM LEADS:\" Catty, cut-throat, yet completely spineless, you are destined to remain at your current job for the rest of your life. Unable to make a single decision you tend to measure your worth by the number of meetings you can schedule for yourself. Best suited to marry other, \"Middle Managers,\" as everyone in your social circle is a, \"Middle Manager.\" SENIOR MANAGEMENT: Catty, cut-throat, yet completely spineless, you are destined to remain at your current job for the rest of your life. Unable to make a single decision you tend to measure your worth by the number of meetings you can schedule for yourself. Best suited to marry other, \"Senior Managers,\" as everyone in your social circle is a, \"Senior Manager.\" CUSTOMER SERVICE: Bright, cheery, positive, you are a fifty-cent cab ride from taking your own life. As a child very few of you asked your parents for a little cubicle for your room and a headset so you could pretend to play, \"Customer Service.\" Continually passed over for promotions, your best bet is to sleep with your boss.",

After he got to his hotel, he farted and strangely it sounded like his ass said, \"Honda.\" Puzzled, he forced out another fart and sure enough it came out, \"hooonda.\" Needless to say he was freaked out by this. Every time he farted, it came out, \"hooonda.\" He flipped through the phone book and found an American doctor and rushed over. The doctor listened to his bizarre farts, examined him thoroughly then proclaimed he was completely stumped. He sent the salesman to a Japanese doctor that specialized in rare diseases, but this doctor too didn't have a clue. He made an emergency appointment with a gastroenterologist. He too was baffled. On his way out of the last doctor's office, he was panicking. He had to cancel the meeting. How embarrassing would it be if in the middle of the chairman of Toyota's office he let a fart slip and it came out, \"hooonda!\" Just before he went out of the office door, the receptionist called after him. \"The doctor recommends you try going to a dentist.\" \"A dentist?\" He thought. What the heck. He was desperate at this point so he called a local dentist. When he arrived and described his problem to the old Japanese dentist, the dentist nodded his head and said, \"you have abscessed tooth.\" \"An abscessed tooth?!?\" The incredulous salesman says. \"Why the hell do you say that?\" To which the dentist replied, \"Everybody knows abscess make the fart go Honda,.\"",

Reaching under his desk, Yeltsin produces two envelopes marked 1 and 2. \"Take these letters,\" he tells Putin. \"Keep them safely -- don't open them. Only if the country is in turmoil and things start going badly, open the first one. That'll give you some advice on what to do. And, even after that, if things start going REALLY badly, open the second one.\" And with a sigh, Yeltsin leaves the office. Well, Putin succeeded him, and sure enough, within a few years things started going badly -- unemployment increased, hotels crumbled during Sochi, people became restless. Vladimir decided it was time to open the first letter. All it said was: \"Blame everything on me!\" So Putin launched a massive de-Yeltsin-Western campaign, and blamed the west and Yeltsin for all the excesses and faults and ills of the present system, and bought himself some time that way. But things continued on the downslide -- Viktor Yanukovych was removed in Ukraine, Crimea was taken, tensions increased, the EU was unhappy with Putin's leadership and upstarts like Nemtsov were threatening his credibility. So finally, after much deliberation, Putin opened the second letter. All it said was: \"Write two letters.\"",

The negotiations are going very well, but Mr. Oki can't seem to close the deal with the lawyer. The lawyer seems tired from his long trip and aggitated as a result. So - as is accustomed in Japan - mr. Oki arranges a special surprise for the lawyer: A gorgeous Japanese prositute to unwind the lawyer, will be waiting for him in his hotel room. The lawyer indeed finds a gorgeous woman waiting for him on his bed in his hotel room. Without any hesitation, he accepts this generous offer from the Japanese firm and begins to have wild, animal sex with the woman.

And when he starts to really pound her, the screams get even louder: \"Naki Naki! NAKI NAKI!\" The lawyer concludes that this must be an expression of great joy in Japanese. Even as they're coming to an amazing climax, her last words are \"... Naki.. Naki...\" Before she falls asleep on the bed. The next day the lawyer meets up with mr. Oki on the golf course. The lawyer thanks mr. Oki for an amazing night, and mr. Oki is pleased to see him in such a good mood now. The lawyer - pretty full of himself after his spectacular performance last night - proceeds to hit a hole-in-one. Cocky and proud to show off his newly learned Japanese, he exclaims: \"Yeah!

I would be ever so grateful and devote my life to you if you would just cure me of this cursed affliction.\" Every night the boy would recite this prayer, but alas his prayer remained unanswered. Time passed and the boy became a teenager. Once again he watched his friends play sports, drive, and start to explore emotions of love and romance. Still the boy prayed every night for god to cure him, and still his prayers remained unanswered. Eventually the teen became a man. All his friends got married and started families. They no longer had any time to spend with him and the paraplegic man became very lonely. Despite this he still prayed every night to have the ability to lead a normal life. Finally one night, after a particularly emotional prayer, a bright light began to emanate from the sky. A heveanly choir began to sing as the clouds spread and the light shone right on the paraplegic man. Much to his surprise, god then appeared above him, and a warm majestic glow filled the man's heart.

The bartender is quite curious and asks the man what's inside. \"I'll show you if you get me a beer,\" the man says. The bartender accepts the deal and gets the guest a beer. He then opens the box and takes out a man of 30 centimeters high and a small piano. The tiny guy directly starts playing the piano. The bartender is amazed and shouts out: \"That's awesome dude. Where did you get that?\" The man replies: \"I will tell you if you get me another beer.\" Of course the bartender gets him a beer right away. As the man is sipping from it he explains: \"I got it from a genie in a magic lamp.\" The bartender gets really enthousiastic and says: \"You have a genie in a lamp? If you let me use it just once, I'll get you another beer.\" The guy is still pretty thirsty and accepts this offer. As he is drinking his third beer he hands over the lamp. The bartender rubs it and a genie pops out, who says: \"Master, I can grant you one wish. What will that be?\" The bartender shouts out: \"I want a million bucks!\" A few seconds later the bar is full of ducks, shitting all over the place. \"What the hell is this?\" Screams the bartender. \"I wished for a million bucks, not a million ducks.\" His costumer says with a sad face: \"Yeah, that genie has quite the hearing problem.

He'd play any instrument you have here better than you've ever heard played before--\" The bartender cuts him off with a chortle. The guy doesn't miss a beat, \"And I'll bet you 50 bucks on an instrument of your choice.\" The bartender takes the bet and points to the piano. The octopus hops off the guy's shoulder, waltzes over to the piano, hops up and proceeds to tickle the ivories better than the bartender has ever heard before. He's flabbergasted. Incredulous. Stupefied. So he does what any man would do, and demands to go double or nothing. \"A lucky fluke, let's go one more time on this trumpet.\" The guy agrees without hesitation, the octopus plays the trumpet, and you know how well he plays it. Better than the bartender has ever heard before. Well, they keep going like this, double or nothing after double or nothing, instrument after instrument, until finally the bartender is into the guy for 3200 dollars. Looking desperate, the bartender says, \"Mac, this has got to end now. Let's go double or nothing just one more time and I either pay you three months of savings or we end up all clear.\" The guy mulls it over, thinking perhaps he should just walk with his guaranteed, substantial winnings. But being a gambler-at-heart and a businessman, he decides to go for it. \"Okay, one last double or nothing, and then we'll settle up.\" The bartender pulls out a set of bagpipes from behind the bar and hands them to the octopus. The octopus just starts fiddling with the pipes. After a minute of this, the guy says, \"Hey, Partner, we've got 6400 bucks on the line, are you gonna play that thing or what?\" The octopus looks at him, surprised, \"Play it?

After a brief dance, he spots someone across the dancefloor. A woman, who despite being rather attractive to his eye, has a deformity which means her mouth is vertical rather than horizontal. He ponders for a moment, and thinks to himself, \"Gee, this must be my lucky night! Finally, someone who is like me. She must know what it's like to be constantly stared at, we can share the burden! I think something could happen here.\" He composes himself, and with his new found confidence, decides he is going to talk to her. As he approaches, their eyes lock.

We got into the most expensive clubs, ran up a huge tab, and got out of paying for a dime of it! We waltzed into the priciest restaurants without reservations and talked our way into getting a free meal immediately. We went to the hottest strip clubs and got free lap dances, and I even had sex with a stripper onstage and nobody dared to fuck with me and my buddies! We were unstoppable!\" The grandfather smiled as he reminisced, remembering fondly his days in Paris. The younger man furrowed his brow and nodded. \"You know what grandpa? You're right. I do need to go out and do something with my life! I'm gonna grab my buddies and go to Paris, and do the exact same things you did!\" \"Atta boy,\" the elderly man responded. Two weeks later, the young man came home from Paris. However, when the expectant grandfather opened the door, he found his grandson in a sling, a neckbrace, and with two horribly black eyes. \"What the fuck happened to you?!\" Grandpa asked. \"I did all the same stuff you did!\" The man replied in dismay. \"We went to the best clubs, drank up a huge tab, but when we tried to leave without paying, the bouncer beat the shit out of me and broke my arm! We tried to push our way into a restaurant, but when we wouldn't leave the police were called and gave me these two black eyes with their night sticks! And worst of all, we went to a strip club, and when I tried to fuck a stripper onstage, I was nearly beaten to death by all the bouncers at once!\" \"Who the hell did you go with?\" Asked the grandpa incredulously. \"A group of my buddies.

All of a sudden a torso shot out from were his neck should be. Stunned I gave him another beer and arms shot out of his torso. People around the bar began to notice and started cheering him on to keep drinking. After every drink another miracle would happen around the bar. At two in the morning I told my son we better get heading home. He begged me to let him have one more drink and was encouraged by the crowd, so I ordered our last drink and gave it to him.

He bought a nice 10 acre hobby farm, moved his family and possesions into the house and was very pleased. Now he needed to get some farm animals. He was new to this, so he decided to walk down the long gravel road to visit his neighbors who were all farmers and see if he could purchase a few animals to get him started. He came to the first farm on his left, walked up the dirt driveway and greeted the farmer. He told him he wanted to buy a rabbit. The farmer looked at him and replied, \"Around here we don't call them rabbits, we call them Peter cotton tails,\" or you can just call them a, \"Peter,\" for short. He thanked him for letting him know and then said he wanted to buy a Peter if the farmer had one he could sell him. The farmer said he would be more than glad to sell him one, stuck a deal, and the city slicker continued down the gravel road on to another farm with his rabbit under one arm. The city slicker comes to the next farm, walks up the dirt driveway again, looks around for the farmer, then tells him he is looking to purchase a hen. The farmer replied, \"Around here we don't call them hens, we call them pullets.\" The city slicker thanked the farmer, then said he would like to purchase a pullet if he could from the farmer. The farmer said he has plenty to spare and would be glad to sell him one. They struck a deal and the city slicker was on his way again down the gravel road, now with one peter and one pullet under each arm. He reached the last farm on the end of the road, walked up to the farmer and told him he was interested in purchasing a mule, and asked if he had one he could sell. The farmer replied, \"Around here we don't call them mules, we call them Ass's.\" Again, the city slicker thanked the farmer and said he would like to purchase an Ass if he had one he could spare. The farmer said he had only one he could spare, and that is was a hard working Ass, but he did have a catch. The city slicker was a little concerned and asked what was wrong with the Ass. The farmer said the mule will be working and pulling nice and hard, and then suddenly stop dead in his tracks, BUT all you had to do was scratch him behind his ear, and he would go right back to work. The city slicker thought that was no real big deal and that he could easily handle that. So city slicker struck up a deal with the farmer and decided to head home with a cock under his right arm, a pullet under his left arm, and the Ass walking beside him. He was almost home when the Ass stopped dead in his tracks right in front of a lady working in her flower garden along the road. The city slicker looked a little distressed, so the lady asked if she could help him. He replied... \"Could you hold my peter and pullet while I scratch my Ass?\"",

Now we're going to eat the sailors!\" \"Look,\" replies Brenda, \"I don't mind doing the blow job but there's no way I'm swallowing Seamen!\"",

At the front of the church they were met by a Vietnamese nun named Banh Hanh. \"She drinks, she smokes and she takes drugs! Is there anyway in which the church can help her?\" Said Mr Connor. \"Of course, we are always open to help those in need,\" replied Banh. Banh then talked for 10 minutes straight to Mr Connor about their intervention sessions which can help Anna. She also talked about her personal life and how this was her last day as the church is transferring her to work in a cathedral in France. However, she said she'll stay if the church still needed her. Mr Connor was delighted and developed a liking towards Banh by how passionately she talked about helping others. As they were lead into the church they met the Vietnamese pastor. \"Hmm, she seems troubled. My best advice would be to send her here to the church every friday night to have an one one one intervention with a nun,\" said the pastor. Mr Connor, wanting to keep Anna's word but also desperate to help her looked to his left to see Banh nodding at him.

Well, let me assure you, that just isn't true. We'll use your skin to make our excellent canoes, your hair to make twine, and we'll eat every edible part of you. So really, it's not a waste at all.

Smoke and ash will be flying everywhere, but this isn't the time you want to spring into action. The next morning, you go back to the hole.

            "joke": "The Red Banana: There once was a boy named little Johnny. Little Johnny loved trains. All he ever wanted to do was play with trains when he was younger and from the age of 8 all he wanted to do when he grew up was become a train conductor. So Little Johnny studied all through grade school and high school and eventually got into the best train conductor university in all the land. Little Johnny graduated that university with flying colors and took a job with the most presitigious train company out there. Now that he was all grown up little johnny was called John, and John loved his job. He loved saying, \"all aboard,\" he loved talking to the passengers asking what stop there were getting off at and hearing why, and he loved driving the train, his train. But one day Johnny snapped, he realized that his whole life he was just driving this train back and forth on the same railroad track, the same destinations, with the same people. He was so disappointed with the monotony that he blew right through a break light at a station and SMASHED into a school bus full of kids. Backpacks flying, pencils, paper everywhere, 19 kids are injured and 3 kids killed. Now the local government couldn't stand for this; And John was convicted to the electric chair. It is common knowledge that before you go to the electric chair you are allowed one meal, and you have to be given it. So john, being the smartass he is asks for a Red Banana from the deepest darkest corner of West Africa. So the hail sends 3 men to west Africa and after a week of searching finally procure this red banana, but on the way back one gets Ebola, the other malaria, luckily the 3rd is unscathed. Now the warden is really pissed so he throws john the red banana, who eats it ferociously, and they douse him with water, attach the head gear, strap him into the electric chair and with a smile the warden flips the switch. Nothing happens. The warden angrily tries it again, nothing. One more time he flips the switch. Again nothing. So because of a loophole in the law books if the electric chair does not work then you have to let the guy go. They let John go and the warden, mystified, asks him what was in the red banana that made the electric chair not work? \"To which John replies,\" nothing, I'm just a bad conductor. \"",

What I will do for you is this: We just received 8 shiney brand new robot golf caddies. If you're willing to take one with you out on the course and come back and tell me how well it works, your round of golf is on me today.\" The golfer obviously accepted the man's offer. He approached the first tee, looked at the fairway and said to himself, \"I think my driver will do the job.\" The robot caddie turned to the man and said, \"No sir. Use your 3 wood. A driver is far too much club for this hole.\" Hesitantly, the golfer pulled out his 3 wood, made good contact with the ball, and the ball landed about 10 feet to the right front of the hole on the green. The golfer, delighted, turned to the robot and thanked him for his assistance. As the golfer pulled out his putter he said, \"I think this green is gonna break left to right.\" The robot then again spoke up and said, \"No sir. I do believe this green will break right to left.\" Thinking about the last time the robot corrected his prediction, he decided again to listen to the machine. He made his putt and birdied the hole thanks to the robot and his advice. But his luck didn't end there. His entire game was the best game he ever played, thanks to the assistance of the new robot golf caddie. Upon returning to the clubhouse, the man behind the counter asked, \"How was your game?\" The golfer stated, \"It was, by far, the BEST game I ever played. Thank you very much for letting me take one of your robots. See you next week.\" A week passed, and excited, the golfer returned to the pro shop. Upon entering, he turned to the man behind the counter and said, \"I would like 18 holes of golf and one of those robot golf caddies, please.\" The gentleman from behind the counter turned to the man and said, \"Well the 18 holes is no problem. However, we no longer have the robots. We had too many complaints.\" Confused, the golfer cried, \"COMPLAINTS? Who in the heck could've complained about those robots? They were incredible.\" The man sighed and said, \"Well, it wasn't their performance. It was that they were made of shiny silver metal, and the sun reflecting off them was blinding to other golfers on the fair way.\" The golfer said, \"So then why didn't you just paint them black?\" The man nodded sadly and replied, \"We did.

I know none of the tools attached to this device and I'm flabbergasted by the fact, seeming to be unaware of the usefulness of this device.

I say, \"hey I'm confused about most of the things in this Swiss Army knife, do you have any idea what they do?\" To which he responds, \"no, no, is not Switzerland Army Knife, is Bulgarian People's Armed Union Knife.\" Wow, I think to myself, I didn't know the Bulgarians had a resource like this. He starts to take apart this unknown piece of history and explains the relevance of each tool. I'm amazed, because most of the definitions he gives for each separate section seem completely useless. \"... This, this car key for universal soviet auto machine, parked every 30 miles from the last, all comrades had a ride home.\" At this point I'm driving myself crazy with this new information, what the fuck did I get myself into? This guy is crazy. Then, it gets better, he pulls out a part of the knife, it's just a thin, flat piece of metal with no apparent end, not a can open, not a knife, not even a fucking nail file. He says to me, \"ah, yis, this is most useful part of Bulgarian survival mechanism.. Screwdriver.\" Finally! Something I know, but what the fuck how the hell is that a screwdriver.

One Sunday was a picture-perfect day for golfing. The sun was out, no clouds were in the sky, and the temperature was just right. The preacher was in a quandary as to what to do, and shortly, the urge to play golf overcame him. He called an assistant to tell him that he was sick and could not do church, packed the car up, and drove three hours to a golf course where no one would recognize him. Happily, he began to play the course. An angel up above was watching the preacher and was quite perturbed. He went to God and said, \"Look at the preacher. He should be punished for what he is doing.\" God nodded in agreement. The preacher teed up on the first hole. He swung at the ball, and it sailed effortlessly through the air and landed right in the cup 250 yards away. A picture-perfect hole-in-one. He was amazed and excited. The angel was a little shocked. He turned to God andsaid, \"I beg your pardon, but I thought you were going to punish him.\" God smiled. \"Think about it-who can he tell?\"",

While locking the door, she accidentally walks into a sticky stain. She leans down to find out what that white and sticky substance is, and she screams: \"Oh My God! This is sperm!\" She actually screams so loud, that Mrs. Dan her neighboor and Mary, the young foreign janitress, come in a few seconds. The three women are offended by the fact that a pervert made this stain just in front of Mrs. Dany's door. So they decide to investigate the stain and find the culprit. Not many options there: Mrs. Smith tastes the sperm, and says: \"Its not my husband! It's definitely not the taste of his sperm.\" Stimulated by the investigation, Mrs. Dan put her finger into the stain and tastes it too. She says: \"Its not my husband,\" and quietly thinks, \"you're right Mrs. Smith it's not your husband too!\" Finally, Mary, the young janitress, also tastes the sperm stain and here is her conclusion: \"Drop it ladies! The man who did that stain does not live in the neighborhood!\"",

Determined to find the source of the illness, the African ebola patient is interrogated for several hours by the experts, but his response to every question is, \"Which doctor gave me ebola!?\" The man flails and kicks about in frustration and anger, and the medical staff become more impatient. After several days pass, the ebola experts finally lose their patience and give up. The man is left alone in the room in critical condition. Another day passes, and an African nurse walks in to check up on the man. The ebola patient is dying, and he can barely speak. He reaches out and grasps the nurse's hand with a soft touch.

The young man, who is innocent, tells him, \"I have nothing to do with it, it is just a hazard of the genetics. It's the same as with sheeps, most of them are white but sometimes a black one is born for no reason.\" The chief steps back a little, gives a frightened look to the missionary, then whispers: \"Ok, I won't say a word about my daugther, but don't you tell anyone about the sheep.\"",

I can't stand seeing him naked any way and really I'm just here because he spends so much money on me.\" The husband nods in agreement so the Cult leader says, \"Welcome to the cult!\" The Husband of the youngest, newlywed, couple says, \"Well, we have been remodeling our new apartment and the other day she dropped a paint brush. When she bent over to pick it up I just had to have her, so we did it right then and there. I gotta be honest I don't think I'll be able to control my urges.\" To this the Cult leader sadly replies, \"Well, I'm sorry but you are not welcome in our cult.\" \"That's ok,\" replies the young wife. \"We're no longer welcome at that Home Depot either.\"",

Steve and his wife had sex every single night and had never been apart from one another since they tied the knot. One evening though Steve came home from work and said, \"Darling, I have some bad news. My company has ordered I go on a business trip for the next two months. I'm going to miss you dearly and I know you're going to miss me. Is there anything I can do for you before I leave?\" \"Well,\" says Steve's wife, \"you know how we have sex every single night?\" \"Yes I know dear.\" Said Steve. \"Well dear husband I want you to go out and buy me a dildo so I can have something to keep me company.\" Steve agrees and goes to the dildo shop. He looks around at all the dildos and sees big ones and small ones and ones with plugs and ones with sparkles. He approaches the shop keep and explains his predicament. \"Well that seems like a tall order,\" the shop keep says, \"two months is a long time for a woman to stay faithful and a hard job for one dildo to do. But I think I've got just the thing.\" The shop keep reaches under his counter and pulls out a box. Steve opens the box to find what appears to be just an ordinary dildo. \"Whats so special about this one?\" Asks Steve. \"Watch this!\" Replies the shop keep, \"I can command it. Voodoo Dildo! The door!\" And just then what seemed to be an ordinary dildo levitates from the box, travels to the door, and thunderously penetrates the keyhole. \"Remarkable!\" Says Steve. \"Now watch this!\" Says the shop keep, \"Voodoo Dildo! The pocket pussies!\" And the Voodoo Dildo switches from the keyhole to fucking the pocket pussies on display in the store. \"Sensational!\" Says Steve. Finally the shop keep stops the Voodoo Dildo by saying, \"Voodoo Dildo! Return!\" And the Voodoo Dildo levitated back to the box. Steve is very impressed by this magical sex toy and gladly purchases it from the store. Steve returns home with the box in hand eager to greet his wife and show off her new present. When he arrives he sees that she has gone to the grocery store. He leaves the package on their bed with instructions hes written on how to activate the Voodoo Dildo. Later in the evening Steve has gone to the airport and his wife has returned home. She spots the package left by her husband and without hesitation begins to open it. Inside she finds the Voodoo Dildo and Steves instructions. After reading the instructions she strips off all of her clothes and says, \"Well I guess we should see what this is all about. Voodoo dildo! My pussy!\" And the Voodoo Dildo begins to give her the best she's ever had. It starts slow but eventually makes her come again and again. After her fourth orgasm she thinks shes had enough but oh no! Steve forgot to include how to make the Voodoo Dildo stop! She tries pulling it and grabbing it but it wont stop. She calls 911 but the operator tells her not to make prank calls on the emergency hotline. She rushes to find anything she can to stop it but it just wont. She climaxes again and finally decides to put on her clothes and drive to the hospital. Once shes in her car she can barely drive.

Every time he was leaving for work in the field, his wife would make him very delicious sandwiches. The sandwiches were made out of fresh baked bread, with homemade butter, cheese, ham, and fresh vegetables: Tomatoes, lettuce and cucumbers. Eating them was his favorite part od the day, and he treated them as a reward for hard work he did. One day the peasant went to work in the field and left his sandwiches on a nearby rock as he always did. After a few hours of work, he took a break and headed to the rock to enjoy his lunch, but... It was gone! A little angry and confused, he went back to work. The next day began and it was passing by as usual. Until the lunch time, when the poor man came to the rock to find out his sandwiches disappeared again! He got angry, but there was not much he could do, so he returned to work. On the third day, the situation occured again. It was too much. This time the peasant got really pissed and decided that the next day he would hide behind a tree and wait to reveal the sandwiches thief. He did as he decided. He was waiting well hidden, keeping an eye on his lunch, but there was no living soul around. After an hour, suddenly, a great eagle flew out of nowhere, grabbed the lunch with it's claws and started to fly away. The shocked peasant threw himself into a pursuit of the bird. He followed the eagle until it landed in a nearby forest, not aware of being followed. The peasant hid behind a tree and watched the eagle. The bird unpacked the sandwiches and threw all of the ingredients out: Ham, cheese and fresh vegetables. Then the eagle took two slices of butter-covered bread, apllied them to it's chest rubbing them all over it, and said, \"oh my god, I am so fucked up.\"",

            "joke": "Voodoo Dick: So a business man has finally come home from his most recent trip. This is the 50th trip this year and his wife is getting really annoyed. This particular time she is really chewing him out saying she doesn't get laid enough and she has finally decided to divorce him and take half his things. The businessman pleads for his wife to stay, saying he will do anything for her. She asks him to make love to her right then and there but suddenly his phone rings. It's his boss and he tells the businessman to get to the airport in an hour for a very important deal which he cannot refuse. The wife loses her shit and the business man knows he can't stay but he tells her he will make it up to her somehow. He gets in the car and starts to drive to the airport. On the way he is freaking out knowing his wife is going to do something crazy while he's away. He stops at a red light and looks over to see a sex shop. A lightbulb goes off in his head and he parks and runs into the store. The little bell rings as he enters and he looks around. DVD's, whips, chains, lube, latex suits, mask, dildo. The man is completely overwhelmed so he rings the bell at the counter. A woman walks out from the back and the businessman asks for the most expensive item they carry in the store and that the price is of no concern. The lady take a box out from under the counter, it is covered in dust which she blows off and she opens it. Inside is a piece of wood, whittled into the crude shape of a cock. The businessman looks at the item, perplexed and confused and asks WTH is it suppose to be and how much does it cost. The lady says it is the legendary voodoo dick and it will cost him over 5000$. The businessman becomes outraged and asks why that pathetic looking wooden dildo is 5000$ and the dildo under the counter with a lube dispenser, rotating head and twelve speeds costs only 200$ the lady tells him the powers of the voodoo dick are not to be underestimated and gives him a demonstration. She leans in and tells the voodoo dick to fuck the female customer by the dvd rack. The voodoo dick starts to float out of the box the flies full speed across the store, up the womans dress and starts to fuck her silly, knocking DVD's all over the ground. She tells the voodoo dick to stop fucking the female customer and it flies back into the box and the lid magically closes. The business man slaps the money on the counter and buys it right away. He rushes home and gives his wife the gift and instructions then leaves for the airport, confident he just saved his marriage. For the first day the wife just looks at the box insulted her husband would get her a dildo. The second day she has some thoughts about using it but doesn't and on the third day she is watching Dr. Phil and decides 'fuckit' then brings the box into the bedroom and gets on the bed and takes the voodoo dick out of the box. She tells the voodoo dick to fuck her and it flies right into her pussy and gives her five orgasms in a minute. She can't take it anymore and tells the voodoo dick to stop but it continues its rampage inside her vagina. She freaks out and tries to put her clothes back on but she falls all over the place, when she finally manages to do that she goes into the garage and tries to get into her car. Fumbling and dropping her keys a few times she gets in and drives as fast as she can to the hospital. She is swerving and speeding until she sees the cherries of a cop car in her rearview mirror. She pulls over and this state trooper looking cop comes up to her window and taps on the glass with his flashlight. She rolls down her window and the cop asks her why she was speeding and tells her she could've killed someone, he demands to know an explanation for all of the reckless driving and she tells him about the voodoo dick. The cop looks at her with a stern expression, takes off his glasses, looks her right in the eyes and goes, \"Voodoo dick my ASS.\"",

His father thinking that it was an important day for his young lad, said to him, 'You can have anything that you want for your birthday'. The boy thought and thought. Finally, he said to his pop, \"Dad, I want a green golf ball.\" The man was surprised a bit, but decided to humour his son. And so, the boy received 1 green golf ball for his 10th birthday. On this boy's 13th birthday, when he hit his teens, the father once again walked up to the boy, and told him what he had before. The boy thought. And thought. Finally, he said, \"Dad, I want 10 green golf balls.\" Now, the father was slightly curious about this, and he almost asked his son why. But then he decided that it was just youthfulness, and left it at that. Upon graduating from High School, the boy was once again given that same offer by his father. He thought and thought and thought. Finally, he went up to his old man and said, \"Dad, I want 100 green golf balls.\" Now, the father was very curious about this, and asked his son, finally, why he wanted the balls. The boy just said, \"Dad! It's a secret!\" The father backed down, and got the boy his balls. When the boy graduated from college, his father once again offered him anything he wanted. Once again, the boy thought. Once again, the boy walked up to his father. He said, \"Dad, I want 1000 green golf balls.\" The father decided that the boy knew how to live his life. But still he asked, \"Why, son? Why do you want these green golf balls?\" And once again, the boy said, \"It's a secret, Dad!\" And then came the war. And the boy volunteered himself for his country. And when he came back in one piece, his father said, \"Son, I will get you anything that you want!\" And the boy thought. And thought. And he said, \"Dad, I want 10,000 green golfballs.\" And the father could not hold back his question any longer. \"Why? Why, son? Why do you need these green golf balls?\" And the son looked at thim, and he said, \"Dad, now, I told you that it was a secret. Please don't make me tell you.\" And the father backed off. The boy got married. His father walked up to him, and offered him anything he would want on this joyous occasion. The boy thought and thought and thought. And thought. And, finally, he said, \"Dad... I want 100,000 green golf balls...\" And the father, keeping calm, asked why. Why the boy wanted so many green golf balls. And all the boy could do was look at his father, and say, \"It's a secret.\" And the father kept silent. Then, tragedy struck. There was a car accident. The boy was mortally injured. And the father went to see the son in his final hour. And he asked his son if there was anything he could get him. And the son whispered, \"Father... Please get me 1,000, 000 green golf balls...\" And the father almost wept.

Have sex with her and well we'll make sure your tab is endless.\" Starting off the man eats the eggs from the liquor, and slowly drinks the liquid until the jar is empty. At this point the man is pretty drunk and stumbles out the back door where grumpy lies waiting. From inside the bar you hear a loud growl, the complete silence. The man returns inside and asks the bartender, \"Wheres the lady with the sore tooth?\"",

The three men agree and the devil approaches each of them separately.

The devil solves it and hands it right back to him. The mathematician says, \"Alright, I'll go to hell.\" And off he went. The devil then approaches the philosopher and says for him to give him any sophisticated philosophical idea, and he'll explain it. So the philosopher does this and gives it to the devil. The devil, again, explains it and the philosopher agrees to go to hell. Finally, the devil goes up to the idiot and says in an annoyed tone, \"Alright, wattaya got?\" The idiot thinks for a second and then declares, \"Get me a chair.\" The devil complies and gets the idiot a chair. \"Alright, now drill seven holes in it.\" Again the devil complies and drills seven holes. Then, the idiot sits down in the chair and he farts. \"Alright,\" the idiot declared with a grin. \"Which hole did my fart come out of?\" The devil was taken aback, and stood confused at the idiot. \"Uhh, that one!\" The devil said as he pointed to a random hole. \"No stupid.

He says to Janice, \"honey I've wanted to go on this helicopter ride for a while now can we just go?\" Janice says to him, \"John I'll tell you the same I told you last year, ten dollars is ten dollars.\" This happens a few more years until the pilot is tired of them bickering about it and comes up with a solution. He says to John and Janice, \"I'll take you both up for free but the catch is, if anyone of you talk I'll charge ten dollars.\" Satisfied with the compromise Janice agrees, so they go up and the pilot is trying every maneuver possible to try to get them to scream or talk, but without fail neither talk. When they land the pilot sees Janice is no longer in the helicopter and asks John, \"what happened to Janice?\" John then exclaims, \"she fell out about 5 minutes into the ride.\" \"Well why didn't you say anything?\" Asks the pilot. And without missing a beat John says, \"well ten dollars is ten dollars.\"",

Several students raised their hands but in the back Johnny, a notoriously foul mouthed kid, was jumping up and down pleading to be called on. The teacher, thinking Johnny would say something like, \"asshole,\" skipped hima dn called on Jennifer. \"Apple.\" Jennifer said. \"Very good Jennifer!\" Said the teacher. Next was B. Again Johnny was jumping up and down with a raised hand. The teacher, thinking Johnny would say butthole or bastards instead called on Tommy. \"Baseball,\" said Tommy. Next was C and Johnny immediately began jumping up and down wanting to be called on. The teacher thought for sure Johnny would say Cunt so she called on Alice. \"Cat,\" said Alice. On through the alphabet they went and by the time they reached R it became too obvious the teacher was ignoring Johnny. She couldn't think of a bad word that began with R so she cautiously called upon Johnny. \"RATS Teacher!\" He exclaimed. The teacher was relieved, not the best word but not that bad. But Johnny wasn't done. \"Big fucking rats, teacher, with huge cocks like that,\" spreading his arms as wide as he could.",

A new woman joined their Club. She overheard the guys talking about their golf round. She said, \"You know, I used to play on my golf team in college and I was pretty good. Would you mind if I joined you next week?\" The three guys looked at each other. Not one of them wanted to say 'yes', but she had them on the spot. Finally, one man said it would be okay, but they would be starting early - at 6:30 a. M. He figured the early tee-time would discourage her. The woman said this may be a problem, and asked if she could be up to 15 minutes late. They rolled their eyes, but said okay. She smiled and said, \"Good, I'll be there at 6:30 or 6:45.\" She showed up at 6:30 sharp, and beat all three of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round. She was fun and a pleasant person, and the guys were impressed. Back at the clubhouse, they congratulated her and invited her back the next week. She smiled, and said, \"I'll be there at 6:30 or 6:45.\" The next week she again showed up at 6:30 sharp. Only this time, she played left-handed. The three guys were incredulous as she still beat them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand. They were totally amazed. They couldn't figure her out. She was again very pleasant and didn't seem to be purposely showing them up. They invited her back again, but each man harbored a burning desire to beat her. The third week, the guys had their game faces on. But this time, she was 15 minutes late, which made the guys irritable. This week the lady played right-handed, and narrowly beat all three of them. The men mused that her late arrival was due to petty gamesmanship on her part. However, she was so gracious and so complimentary of their strong play, they couldn't hold a grudge. Back in the clubhouse, all three guys were shaking their heads. This woman was a riddle no one could figure out. They had a couple of beers, and finally, one of the men asked her point blank, \"How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?\" The lady blushed, and grinned. \"That's easy,\" she said. \"When my Dad taught me to play golf, I learned I was ambidextrous. I like to switch back and forth. When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Before I left in the morning for golf practice, I would pull the covers off him. If his unit was pointing to the right, I played right-handed; If it was pointed to the left, I played left-handed.\" The guys on the team thought this was hysterical. Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys shot back, \"But what if it's pointing straight up?\" She said, \"Then, I'm fifteen minutes late.\"",

On this planet there was a mountain, and atop the mountain was a tree which hosted the most delicious fruit known the the Trid race. But there was a problem: There was a cave near the top that was home to a monster, and every time the trids tried to climb to the top of the mountain, the monster would run out and kick them all back down. The trids became tired of this, and so they contacted Earth to ask for help. Earth didn't find this to be that big of a problem as they were at war and dealing with many different things, so they sent over a rabi. The Trids were happy to have any help they could get, and so they gladly accepted. The rabbi arrived and wanted to get straight to business, calling all of the Trids to the base of the mountain. A lot of them were too frightened, so only some showed up. The rabi led the Trids most of the way up the mountain, only to have the monster come out and kick all of the Trids down but not the rabbi. Frustrated, the rabbi went to the Trid village and told them that in order to get to the top, they would all have to show up and work together. The next day more Trids showed up, but not all of them were there. The rabbi sighed, leading them up to have the monster once again kick down all of the trids, but leave him standing. The rabbi went back to the Trid village and told them that if every single last Trid wasn't in attendence the following day, he would return to Earth without helping them. The next day, every single Trid was there. The rabbi smiled and started leading the Trids up the mountain, this time quite confident that they would make it all the way up. But as usual, the monster ran out of his cave and managed to kick every single Trid back down the mountain, once again leaving the rabbi standing. The rabbi went to the monster's cave and asked, \"Monster, why do you only ever kick down the trids, but always leave me standing?\" To which the monster replied, \"Silly rabbi, kicks are for Trids.\"",

He would climb all of the world's famous buildings - the eiffel tower, the empire state, chrysler, leaning tower of pisa, taj mahal... He was adventurous, to say the least. He started off using rappelling equipment, but as he developed skill he would freely climb with nothing but the clothes on his back. He became more and more ambitious as he ages, wanting to climb towers faster and to higher heights. Finally he got desperate - he needed a more exhilirating thrill, so he funded the construction of a skyscraper to end all skyscrapers, an enormous monument to engineering and to mankind. Construction took years, and by the time it was finished he was nearly an old man - but he was determined to climb his tower. He had one floor of the tower commissioned for a special purpose - when he ascended the north face and reached that floor, his polyester suit would fasten to a contraption and affix him there permanently. He would rise the tower, reach the contraption, and let go - suspending him in an artistic sky-bound mausoleum. He would remain there as a symbol of his youthful endeavors and spirit. It was poetic, really, the day he climbed the tower and ended his life near the top. It must have taken the effort of a man hardened by a life of struggle and endurance. Years have passed since he died, and now people are beginning to doubt the validity of his legend. His memory might be lost on some, but one thing is absolutely sure: Atop the tower lies a hero. That's his storey, and he's sticking to it.",

The wheel slowly rotates and as Garry passes Bruce he waves wildly and excitedly at Bruce. Bruce seems to be preoccupied and chatting to another man on the ground. The wheel slowly goes around again and once more Garry waves his arms around wildly. Again Bruce doesn't pay any attention still talking to some other guy. Once again the wheel travels around and again Garry is waving like a crazy guy trying to get the attention of Bruce. Out of nowhere there is a sickening, grinding, crunching sound of metal breaking apart and the whole wheel starts to crumble. Everyone is screaming, bodies are falling to the ground from great heights. Broken glass, smashed carriages, twisted metal litter the carnival grounds. Bruce frantically searches for Garry amongst the chaos and mess. Finally under a large piece of steel girder Bruce gets a glimpse of a maroon jacket just like the one Garry was wearing. Using all his strength he lifts the girder and sure enough Garry is laying there with his eyes blankly staring into space. Fearing the worst Bruce leans forward and whispers, \"Garry, Garry are you hurt.\" Garry immediately sits up and yells, \"HURT, HURT I'm absolutely devastated, I waved at you three times as I went around on that wheel and you didn't wave back once.\"",

There is an operation that could be done to have it removed and you would still be able to urinate but not ejaculate.

Satisfied by what he achieved, he showed his work to the chicken. \"That's amazing!\" Said the chicken, \"I bet I could put some vocals on that if I practiced!\" The chicken then took a year of its life to learn how to sing while the Horse played. They then decided to show the pig. \"That's so cool!\" Said the pig, \"but it's missing something... I know! Drums!\" The pig then decided to take a year out of his life to learn how to play the drums with the other two. The three then proceeded to show the Sheep, who was amazed by this. She also decided to learn how to play the bass guitar with the rest of the animals. In this time they formed a band, and decided to tour the farm for 4 years, playing for a little extra money on the side, before the Horse got a call from a music agency. They finally got their big break to play at a famous music festival in America. The horse decided to make sure everything was going as planned, and flew over to America to set up stage and confirm their hotel reservations, playing time etc. After his hard few days, he sat in his Hotel room watching the news. On the news their was a report that an airplane had crashed into the Atlantic ocean. There were no survivors from the wreck. He suddenly realised that it was the plane that the Chicken, the Sheep and the Pig were on. Realising that he spent most of his horse life doing something that just went up in flames, he decided he needed a VERY stiff drink. He went down to the hotel bar, asking the bar man for the strongest drink he had. A few minutes later the barman came back and placed the drink on the countertop. He then proceeded to dry a glass, asking the horse a question, \"So, why the long face?\"",

I'm gonna be busy all day.\" \"Well, that sucks,\" says Superman. \"I guess I'll see ya around.\" And he flies off to New York City to visit Peter Parker's apartment. \"Hey, Spidey,\" he says. \"Wanna grab a pizza and a couple brewskis?\" \"Sorry buddy,\" says Spiderman. \"I've been blowing Maryjane off lately, and I promised I'd take her out tonight.\" \"Well, damn,\" says Superman. \"I guess I'll see ya around.\" So Superman is flying around, bored out of his mind, when he finds himself over Wonder Woman's apartment. Using his x-ray vision, he spies her laying on her bed, butt naked, with her legs up in the air. \"I know what to do,\" Superman says to himself. \"I'll use my super speed to fly through her wall and bang her.\" So he flies down there and, in a matter of seconds, he finishes inside her and takes off. \"What the hell was that?\" Exclaims Wonder Woman. Then the Invisible Man sits up and says, \"I don't know but my ass hurts like hell.\"",
